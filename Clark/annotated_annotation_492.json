CNDs were fabricated by the alkali-assisted ultrasonication treatment of glucose, based on a previously reported method (with minor modifications) 53.Firstly, 18 g of glucose was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water and mixed with a 1.0 M NaOH solution Nano Res. (prepared by dissolving 4 g of NaOH in 100 mL of deionized water).The mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 h, resulting in a dark brown solution.The crude solution was neutralized (pH 7) using 0.1 M HCl.The solution was then filtered using an ultrafiltration membrane (M W CO 1,000) to remove impurities.After filtration, a brown solution was obtained, implying the successful production of CNDs.The CND solution was freeze-dried to obtain a solid CND sample. Firstly, 1 g of pCN was dispersed in 90 mL of deionized water.Ultrasonication was then applied to the suspension for 30 min.Next, a measured mass of the solid CND sample was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water and sonicated for 15 min, before being added to the pCN suspension.The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 30 min to produce a uniform suspension.The mixture was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment in a Teflon-sealed autoclave with stirring at 120 C for 4 h.Once cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm.The solid sample was collected and washed several times with deionized water, then dried at 70 C for 12 h.Using this synthesis route, a series of CND/pCN samples were successfully fabricated with various mass loadings of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).These samples were labeled as CND/pCN-1, CND/pCN-2, CND/pCN-3, and CND/ pCN-4, respectively.For comparison, a mechanically combined pCN and CND sample, having the same CND content as the CND/pCN-3 sample, was produced by mixing the pCN and CNDs in an agate mortar for 10 min.This sample was designated as CND/pCN-3M. Measurements of zeta potentials were conducted using a particle analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments).Specifically, a 25 mg sample was dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water and sonicated at room temperature for 15 min to improve dispersion.The surface morphologies and lattice spacing of the composites were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Phillips CM200 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV).The sample was suspended in ethanol, and a drop of the suspension was placed onto a lacey-film-coated copper grid.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of bulk g-C 3 N 4 were obtained with a Hitachi SU8010.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA Instruments Q50, with a heating rate of 10 Cmin -1 from room temperature to 800 C under N 2 flow.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.02 s -1 .The accelerating voltage used was 40 kV, and the applied current was 40 mA.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were acquired by a Thermo-Nicolet iS10, using a standard KBr pellet technique.Each spectrum was generated with a resolution of 4 cm -1 from the average of 32 scans between 4,000 and 600 cm -1 .An Agilent Cary 100 ultraviolet-visible light (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples from 200 to 800 nm.The absorbance was measured relative to BaSO 4 as the blank sample.Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, a scanning speed of 500 nmmin -1 , and excitation and emission slit widths of 10 nm.X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured in a vacuum chamber (2 10 -9 mbar) by a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a monochromated Al-K source at 13 kV and 150 W. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted at ambient temperature on a Bruker EMX-plus X-Band EPR spectrometer.The EPR spectrum was measured at 9.842 GHz with a microwave power of 0.6325 mW and a modulation amplitude of 1 G. Raman spectra were obtained using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer at ambient temperature using UV laser excitation (325 nm).To identify the fluorescence lifetimes of each sample, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using a timecorrelated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system (Picoquant Microtime-200) with a laser excitation wavelength of 405 nm.Nano Res. To examine the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts, the photoreduction of CO 2 was performed as described in our previous reports.The reaction was performed in a custom-built continuous gasphase photoreactor at ambient temperature (25 5 C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm) 8,18,26,43,44.Three quartz column reactors were linked in series, and then placed in a black box to prevent interference from ambient light.The photocatalytic reactions were initiated using a xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM500W) equipped with various filters (including a UV cut-off filter ( 400 nm) and an air mass (AM1.5)filter).The UV cut-off filter was attached to remove UV light and ensure the photocatalysts were activated only by visible light.The mean light intensity of the visible light was determined by an Avantes fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-128) coupled to a cosine corrector.The photocatalyst samples (50 mg) were coated onto glass rods using double-sided tape which were then fixed into quartz tubes.High-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through water before reaching the reactor, forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor in the reactor.The photoreactor was continuously purged for half-an-hour with wet CO 2 , to ensure that the air in the reactor was totally removed and that complete adsorption of gas molecules was achieved.The reactions were then initiated by the xenon light source and the flow rate of CO 2 was held constant at 5 mLmin -1 using a mass flow controller (Brooks 0254 Series).During the photoreactions, the gaseous products were collected downstream, hourly, for a total reaction duration of 10 h and their compositions were analyzed using an inline gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Measuring the gas compositions allowed the measurement of the rates of CH 4 and CO production.The photocatalytic experiments were repeated using an AM1.5 filter attached to the xenon lamp to simulate solar light.The spectra of the visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light are shown in Figs.S1 andS2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at least twice under identical reaction conditions, to ascertain the reproducibility of the results.In all cases, results were consistent; with errors of less than 5.The rate of evolution of CH 4 or CO over 10 h of a lightactivated reaction is shown in Eq. ( 1 C initial and C final denote the initial and final concentrations of CO or CH 4 in the product gas, respectively, V represents the volumetric flow rate of the gaseous products, and m is the mass of photocatalyst used. Photoelectrochemical measurements of the photocatalysts were taken with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N), using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation system.This system comprises a carbon fiber working electrode, with samples covering an active area of 2 cm 2 , a platinum foil as a counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode.For the preparation of the working electrodes, 20 mg of the photocatalyst to be studied was sonicated with 5 mL of ethanol for 5 min to improve the dispersal and homogeneity.The suspension was then drop-cast onto the active area (2 cm 2 ) of the carbon fiber electrode.The fiber was then heated at 150 C for 2 h in an oven, to increase the adhesion of the sample onto the carbon fiber.Meanwhile, a 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution was purged with N 2 for 30 min prior to the PEC measurements, and continuously purged with N 2 during the PEC analyses to eliminate any dissolved O 2 .A water jacket was positioned between the PEC cell system and the xenon arc lamp, to lessen the effects of heat on the Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution during irradiation.For the amperometric measurements, the working electrode was illuminated with a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter attached to remove UV radiation.The transient photocurrent response results were measured with the lamp on and off, under a constant applied bias of 0.5 V. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured over a frequency range of 10 -2 Nano Res. to 10 5 Hz at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an alternating current perturbation signal of 0.01 V under visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Mott-Schottky plots were acquired over a potential range from -1.7 to 0.6 V, with a potential step of 10 mV at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz. We employed a well-established DFT-based ab initio method; the plane-wave projector-augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP).For structural relaxation calculations, the potential with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form, as supplied in the CASTEP was used.For geometry optimization, all forces on the atoms were converged to less than 0.01 eV -1 , the maximum ionic displacement was within 0.001 A and the total stress tensor was reduced to 0.02 GPa.The electronic structures were calculated with a basis set, consisting of the atomic orbitals of C, O, N, and H atoms with a 3 3 1 k-mesh.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst", "source": "In summary, we have designed a metal-free 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst, for Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of 0D/2D CND/pCN samples by means of electrostatic attraction.", "context": "In summary, we have designed a metal-free 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst, for Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of 0D/2D CND/pCN samples by means of electrostatic attraction.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

To examine the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts, the photoreduction of CO 2 was performed as described in our previous reports.The reaction was performed in a custom-built continuous gasphase photoreactor at ambient temperature (25 5 C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm) 8,18,26,43,44.Three quartz column reactors were linked in series, and then placed in a black box to prevent interference from ambient light.The photocatalytic reactions were initiated using a xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM500W) equipped with various filters (including a UV cut-off filter ( 400 nm) and an air mass (AM1.5)filter).The UV cut-off filter was attached to remove UV light and ensure the photocatalysts were activated only by visible light.The mean light intensity of the visible light was determined by an Avantes fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-128) coupled to a cosine corrector.The photocatalyst samples (50 mg) were coated onto glass rods using double-sided tape which were then fixed into quartz tubes.High-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through water before reaching the reactor, forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor in the reactor.The photoreactor was continuously purged for half-an-hour with wet CO 2 , to ensure that the air in the reactor was totally removed and that complete adsorption of gas molecules was achieved.The reactions were then initiated by the xenon light source and the flow rate of CO 2 was held constant at 5 mLmin -1 using a mass flow controller (Brooks 0254 Series).During the photoreactions, the gaseous products were collected downstream, hourly, for a total reaction duration of 10 h and their compositions were analyzed using an inline gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Measuring the gas compositions allowed the measurement of the rates of CH 4 and CO production.The photocatalytic experiments were repeated using an AM1.5 filter attached to the xenon lamp to simulate solar light.The spectra of the visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light are shown in Figs.S1 andS2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at least twice under identical reaction conditions, to ascertain the reproducibility of the results.In all cases, results were consistent; with errors of less than 5.The rate of evolution of CH 4 or CO over 10 h of a lightactivated reaction is shown in Eq.

Photoelectrochemical measurements of the photocatalysts were taken with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N), using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation system.This system comprises a carbon fiber working electrode, with samples covering an active area of 2 cm 2 , a platinum foil as a counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode.For the preparation of the working electrodes, 20 mg of the photocatalyst to be studied was sonicated with 5 mL of ethanol for 5 min to improve the dispersal and homogeneity.The suspension was then drop-cast onto the active area (2 cm 2 ) of the carbon fiber electrode.The fiber was then heated at 150 C for 2 h in an oven, to increase the adhesion of the sample onto the carbon fiber.Meanwhile, a 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution was purged with N 2 for 30 min prior to the PEC measurements, and continuously purged with N 2 during the PEC analyses to eliminate any dissolved O 2 .A water jacket was positioned between the PEC cell system and the xenon arc lamp, to lessen the effects of heat on the Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution during irradiation.For the amperometric measurements, the working electrode was illuminated with a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter attached to remove UV radiation.The transient photocurrent response results were measured with the lamp on and off, under a constant applied bias of 0.5 V. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured over a frequency range of 10 -2 Nano Res. to 10 5 Hz at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an alternating current perturbation signal of 0.01 V under visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Mott-Schottky plots were acquired over a potential range from -1.7 to 0.6 V, with a potential step of 10 mV at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz. We employed a well-established DFT-based ab initio method; the plane-wave projector-augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP).For structural relaxation calculations, the potential with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form, as supplied in the CASTEP was used.For geometry optimization, all forces on the atoms were converged to less than 0.01 eV -1 , the maximum ionic displacement was within 0.001 A and the total stress tensor was reduced to 0.02 GPa.The electronic structures were calculated with a basis set, consisting of the atomic orbitals of C, O, N, and H atoms with a 3 3 1 k-mesh.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "simulated solar light", "source": "The photocatalytic experiments were repeated using an AM1.5 filter attached to the xenon lamp to simulate solar light.", "context": "All of the chemicals purchased were employed without any additional purification and were of analytical grade.Deionized water (18.2M cm resistivity) was used in the production of aqueous solutions.For the synthesis of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , thermal polymerization of a urea precursor was performed as per our previous studies 18,424344.In summary, 3 g of urea was placed in a semi-closed crucible, covered, heated to 520 C at a ramping rate of 10 Cmin -1 , and then held at this temperature for 2.5 h.After cooling to room temperature, the resulting light-yellow solid was crushed into powder.Subsequently, the protonation of g-C 3 N 4 was conducted as described in our previous work 18,43.Briefly, 1 g of pure g-C 3 N 4 was dispersed in 200 mL of 0.5 M HCl and ultrasonicated for 1 h to simultaneously remove any unpolymerized molecules and protonate the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 .The mixture was then continuously stirred for 4 h at room temperature.This was followed by centrifugation and repeated washings with deionized water to remove excess HCl.Lastly, the protonated g-C 3 N 4 (pCN) was dried in an oven overnight at 70 C and then ground into powder.

Measurements of zeta potentials were conducted using a particle analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments).Specifically, a 25 mg sample was dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water and sonicated at room temperature for 15 min to improve dispersion.The surface morphologies and lattice spacing of the composites were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Phillips CM200 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV).The sample was suspended in ethanol, and a drop of the suspension was placed onto a lacey-film-coated copper grid.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of bulk g-C 3 N 4 were obtained with a Hitachi SU8010.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA Instruments Q50, with a heating rate of 10 Cmin -1 from room temperature to 800 C under N 2 flow.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.02 s -1 .The accelerating voltage used was 40 kV, and the applied current was 40 mA.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were acquired by a Thermo-Nicolet iS10, using a standard KBr pellet technique.Each spectrum was generated with a resolution of 4 cm -1 from the average of 32 scans between 4,000 and 600 cm -1 .An Agilent Cary 100 ultraviolet-visible light (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples from 200 to 800 nm.The absorbance was measured relative to BaSO 4 as the blank sample.Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, a scanning speed of 500 nmmin -1 , and excitation and emission slit widths of 10 nm.X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured in a vacuum chamber (2 10 -9 mbar) by a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a monochromated Al-K source at 13 kV and 150 W. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted at ambient temperature on a Bruker EMX-plus X-Band EPR spectrometer.The EPR spectrum was measured at 9.842 GHz with a microwave power of 0.6325 mW and a modulation amplitude of 1 G. Raman spectra were obtained using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer at ambient temperature using UV laser excitation (325 nm).To identify the fluorescence lifetimes of each sample, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using a timecorrelated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system (Picoquant Microtime-200) with a laser excitation wavelength of 405 nm.Nano Res. To examine the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts, the photoreduction of CO 2 was performed as described in our previous reports.The reaction was performed in a custom-built continuous gasphase photoreactor at ambient temperature (25 5 C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm) 8,18,26,43,44.Three quartz column reactors were linked in series, and then placed in a black box to prevent interference from ambient light.The photocatalytic reactions were initiated using a xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM500W) equipped with various filters (including a UV cut-off filter ( 400 nm) and an air mass (AM1.5)filter).The UV cut-off filter was attached to remove UV light and ensure the photocatalysts were activated only by visible light.The mean light intensity of the visible light was determined by an Avantes fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-128) coupled to a cosine corrector.The photocatalyst samples (50 mg) were coated onto glass rods using double-sided tape which were then fixed into quartz tubes.High-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through water before reaching the reactor, forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor in the reactor.The photoreactor was continuously purged for half-an-hour with wet CO 2 , to ensure that the air in the reactor was totally removed and that complete adsorption of gas molecules was achieved.The reactions were then initiated by the xenon light source and the flow rate of CO 2 was held constant at 5 mLmin -1 using a mass flow controller (Brooks 0254 Series).During the photoreactions, the gaseous products were collected downstream, hourly, for a total reaction duration of 10 h and their compositions were analyzed using an inline gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Measuring the gas compositions allowed the measurement of the rates of CH 4 and CO production.The photocatalytic experiments were repeated using an AM1.5 filter attached to the xenon lamp to simulate solar light.The spectra of the visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light are shown in Figs.S1 andS2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at least twice under identical reaction conditions, to ascertain the reproducibility of the results.In all cases, results were consistent; with errors of less than 5.The rate of evolution of CH 4 or CO over 10 h of a lightactivated reaction is shown in Eq. ( 1 C initial and C final denote the initial and final concentrations of CO or CH 4 in the product gas, respectively, V represents the volumetric flow rate of the gaseous products, and m is the mass of photocatalyst used. Photoelectrochemical measurements of the photocatalysts were taken with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N), using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation system.This system comprises a carbon fiber working electrode, with samples covering an active area of 2 cm 2 , a platinum foil as a counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode.For the preparation of the working electrodes, 20 mg of the photocatalyst to be studied was sonicated with 5 mL of ethanol for 5 min to improve the dispersal and homogeneity.The suspension was then drop-cast onto the active area (2 cm 2 ) of the carbon fiber electrode.The fiber was then heated at 150 C for 2 h in an oven, to increase the adhesion of the sample onto the carbon fiber.Meanwhile, a 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution was purged with N 2 for 30 min prior to the PEC measurements, and continuously purged with N 2 during the PEC analyses to eliminate any dissolved O 2 .A water jacket was positioned between the PEC cell system and the xenon arc lamp, to lessen the effects of heat on the Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution during irradiation.For the amperometric measurements, the working electrode was illuminated with a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter attached to remove UV radiation.The transient photocurrent response results were measured with the lamp on and off, under a constant applied bias of 0.5 V. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured over a frequency range of 10 -2 Nano Res. to 10 5 Hz at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an alternating current perturbation signal of 0.01 V under visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Mott-Schottky plots were acquired over a potential range from -1.7 to 0.6 V, with a potential step of 10 mV at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz. We employed a well-established DFT-based ab initio method; the plane-wave projector-augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP).For structural relaxation calculations, the potential with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form, as supplied in the CASTEP was used.For geometry optimization, all forces on the atoms were converged to less than 0.01 eV -1 , the maximum ionic displacement was within 0.001 A and the total stress tensor was reduced to 0.02 GPa.The electronic structures were calculated with a basis set, consisting of the atomic orbitals of C, O, N, and H atoms with a 3 3 1 k-mesh.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The CND/pCN-3 experiments recorded the highest CH 4 and CO production levels, with maximum values of 29.23 and 58.82 molg catalyst -1 , respectively, after 10 h of visiblelight activated reaction.", "context": "In summary, we have designed a metal-free 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst, for Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of 0D/2D CND/pCN samples by means of electrostatic attraction.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

CNDs were fabricated by the alkali-assisted ultrasonication treatment of glucose, based on a previously reported method (with minor modifications) 53.Firstly, 18 g of glucose was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water and mixed with a 1.0 M NaOH solution Nano Res. (prepared by dissolving 4 g of NaOH in 100 mL of deionized water).The mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 h, resulting in a dark brown solution.The crude solution was neutralized (pH 7) using 0.1 M HCl.The solution was then filtered using an ultrafiltration membrane (M W CO 1,000) to remove impurities.After filtration, a brown solution was obtained, implying the successful production of CNDs.The CND solution was freeze-dried to obtain a solid CND sample. Firstly, 1 g of pCN was dispersed in 90 mL of deionized water.Ultrasonication was then applied to the suspension for 30 min.Next, a measured mass of the solid CND sample was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water and sonicated for 15 min, before being added to the pCN suspension.The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 30 min to produce a uniform suspension.The mixture was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment in a Teflon-sealed autoclave with stirring at 120 C for 4 h.Once cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm.The solid sample was collected and washed several times with deionized water, then dried at 70 C for 12 h.Using this synthesis route, a series of CND/pCN samples were successfully fabricated with various mass loadings of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).These samples were labeled as CND/pCN-1, CND/pCN-2, CND/pCN-3, and CND/ pCN-4, respectively.For comparison, a mechanically combined pCN and CND sample, having the same CND content as the CND/pCN-3 sample, was produced by mixing the pCN and CNDs in an agate mortar for 10 min.This sample was designated as CND/pCN-3M. Measurements of zeta potentials were conducted using a particle analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments).Specifically, a 25 mg sample was dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water and sonicated at room temperature for 15 min to improve dispersion.The surface morphologies and lattice spacing of the composites were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Phillips CM200 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV).The sample was suspended in ethanol, and a drop of the suspension was placed onto a lacey-film-coated copper grid.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of bulk g-C 3 N 4 were obtained with a Hitachi SU8010.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA Instruments Q50, with a heating rate of 10 Cmin -1 from room temperature to 800 C under N 2 flow.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.02 s -1 .The accelerating voltage used was 40 kV, and the applied current was 40 mA.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were acquired by a Thermo-Nicolet iS10, using a standard KBr pellet technique.Each spectrum was generated with a resolution of 4 cm -1 from the average of 32 scans between 4,000 and 600 cm -1 .An Agilent Cary 100 ultraviolet-visible light (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples from 200 to 800 nm.The absorbance was measured relative to BaSO 4 as the blank sample.Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, a scanning speed of 500 nmmin -1 , and excitation and emission slit widths of 10 nm.X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured in a vacuum chamber (2 10 -9 mbar) by a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a monochromated Al-K source at 13 kV and 150 W. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted at ambient temperature on a Bruker EMX-plus X-Band EPR spectrometer.The EPR spectrum was measured at 9.842 GHz with a microwave power of 0.6325 mW and a modulation amplitude of 1 G. Raman spectra were obtained using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer at ambient temperature using UV laser excitation (325 nm).To identify the fluorescence lifetimes of each sample, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using a timecorrelated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system (Picoquant Microtime-200) with a laser excitation wavelength of 405 nm.Nano Res. To examine the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts, the photoreduction of CO 2 was performed as described in our previous reports.The reaction was performed in a custom-built continuous gasphase photoreactor at ambient temperature (25 5 C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm) 8,18,26,43,44.Three quartz column reactors were linked in series, and then placed in a black box to prevent interference from ambient light.The photocatalytic reactions were initiated using a xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM500W) equipped with various filters (including a UV cut-off filter ( 400 nm) and an air mass (AM1.5)filter).The UV cut-off filter was attached to remove UV light and ensure the photocatalysts were activated only by visible light.The mean light intensity of the visible light was determined by an Avantes fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-128) coupled to a cosine corrector.The photocatalyst samples (50 mg) were coated onto glass rods using double-sided tape which were then fixed into quartz tubes.High-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through water before reaching the reactor, forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor in the reactor.The photoreactor was continuously purged for half-an-hour with wet CO 2 , to ensure that the air in the reactor was totally removed and that complete adsorption of gas molecules was achieved.The reactions were then initiated by the xenon light source and the flow rate of CO 2 was held constant at 5 mLmin -1 using a mass flow controller (Brooks 0254 Series).During the photoreactions, the gaseous products were collected downstream, hourly, for a total reaction duration of 10 h and their compositions were analyzed using an inline gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Measuring the gas compositions allowed the measurement of the rates of CH 4 and CO production.The photocatalytic experiments were repeated using an AM1.5 filter attached to the xenon lamp to simulate solar light.The spectra of the visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light are shown in Figs.S1 andS2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at least twice under identical reaction conditions, to ascertain the reproducibility of the results.In all cases, results were consistent; with errors of less than 5.The rate of evolution of CH 4 or CO over 10 h of a lightactivated reaction is shown in Eq.

Photoelectrochemical measurements of the photocatalysts were taken with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N), using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation system.This system comprises a carbon fiber working electrode, with samples covering an active area of 2 cm 2 , a platinum foil as a counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode.For the preparation of the working electrodes, 20 mg of the photocatalyst to be studied was sonicated with 5 mL of ethanol for 5 min to improve the dispersal and homogeneity.The suspension was then drop-cast onto the active area (2 cm 2 ) of the carbon fiber electrode.The fiber was then heated at 150 C for 2 h in an oven, to increase the adhesion of the sample onto the carbon fiber.Meanwhile, a 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution was purged with N 2 for 30 min prior to the PEC measurements, and continuously purged with N 2 during the PEC analyses to eliminate any dissolved O 2 .A water jacket was positioned between the PEC cell system and the xenon arc lamp, to lessen the effects of heat on the Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution during irradiation.For the amperometric measurements, the working electrode was illuminated with a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter attached to remove UV radiation.The transient photocurrent response results were measured with the lamp on and off, under a constant applied bias of 0.5 V. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured over a frequency range of 10 -2 Nano Res. to 10 5 Hz at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an alternating current perturbation signal of 0.01 V under visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Mott-Schottky plots were acquired over a potential range from -1.7 to 0.6 V, with a potential step of 10 mV at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz. We employed a well-established DFT-based ab initio method; the plane-wave projector-augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP).For structural relaxation calculations, the potential with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form, as supplied in the CASTEP was used.For geometry optimization, all forces on the atoms were converged to less than 0.01 eV -1 , the maximum ionic displacement was within 0.001 A and the total stress tensor was reduced to 0.02 GPa.The electronic structures were calculated with a basis set, consisting of the atomic orbitals of C, O, N, and H atoms with a 3 3 1 k-mesh.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "There is no explicit mention of reactor type in the context.", "context": "In summary, we have designed a metal-free 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst, for Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of 0D/2D CND/pCN samples by means of electrostatic attraction.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

CNDs were fabricated by the alkali-assisted ultrasonication treatment of glucose, based on a previously reported method (with minor modifications) 53.Firstly, 18 g of glucose was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water and mixed with a 1.0 M NaOH solution Nano Res. (prepared by dissolving 4 g of NaOH in 100 mL of deionized water).The mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 h, resulting in a dark brown solution.The crude solution was neutralized (pH 7) using 0.1 M HCl.The solution was then filtered using an ultrafiltration membrane (M W CO 1,000) to remove impurities.After filtration, a brown solution was obtained, implying the successful production of CNDs.The CND solution was freeze-dried to obtain a solid CND sample. Firstly, 1 g of pCN was dispersed in 90 mL of deionized water.Ultrasonication was then applied to the suspension for 30 min.Next, a measured mass of the solid CND sample was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water and sonicated for 15 min, before being added to the pCN suspension.The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 30 min to produce a uniform suspension.The mixture was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment in a Teflon-sealed autoclave with stirring at 120 C for 4 h.Once cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm.The solid sample was collected and washed several times with deionized water, then dried at 70 C for 12 h.Using this synthesis route, a series of CND/pCN samples were successfully fabricated with various mass loadings of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).These samples were labeled as CND/pCN-1, CND/pCN-2, CND/pCN-3, and CND/ pCN-4, respectively.For comparison, a mechanically combined pCN and CND sample, having the same CND content as the CND/pCN-3 sample, was produced by mixing the pCN and CNDs in an agate mortar for 10 min.This sample was designated as CND/pCN-3M. Measurements of zeta potentials were conducted using a particle analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments).Specifically, a 25 mg sample was dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water and sonicated at room temperature for 15 min to improve dispersion.The surface morphologies and lattice spacing of the composites were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Phillips CM200 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV).The sample was suspended in ethanol, and a drop of the suspension was placed onto a lacey-film-coated copper grid.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of bulk g-C 3 N 4 were obtained with a Hitachi SU8010.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA Instruments Q50, with a heating rate of 10 Cmin -1 from room temperature to 800 C under N 2 flow.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.02 s -1 .The accelerating voltage used was 40 kV, and the applied current was 40 mA.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were acquired by a Thermo-Nicolet iS10, using a standard KBr pellet technique.Each spectrum was generated with a resolution of 4 cm -1 from the average of 32 scans between 4,000 and 600 cm -1 .An Agilent Cary 100 ultraviolet-visible light (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples from 200 to 800 nm.The absorbance was measured relative to BaSO 4 as the blank sample.Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, a scanning speed of 500 nmmin -1 , and excitation and emission slit widths of 10 nm.X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured in a vacuum chamber (2 10 -9 mbar) by a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a monochromated Al-K source at 13 kV and 150 W. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted at ambient temperature on a Bruker EMX-plus X-Band EPR spectrometer.The EPR spectrum was measured at 9.842 GHz with a microwave power of 0.6325 mW and a modulation amplitude of 1 G. Raman spectra were obtained using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer at ambient temperature using UV laser excitation (325 nm).To identify the fluorescence lifetimes of each sample, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using a timecorrelated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system (Picoquant Microtime-200) with a laser excitation wavelength of 405 nm.Nano Res. To examine the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts, the photoreduction of CO 2 was performed as described in our previous reports.The reaction was performed in a custom-built continuous gasphase photoreactor at ambient temperature (25 5 C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm) 8,18,26,43,44.Three quartz column reactors were linked in series, and then placed in a black box to prevent interference from ambient light.The photocatalytic reactions were initiated using a xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM500W) equipped with various filters (including a UV cut-off filter ( 400 nm) and an air mass (AM1.5)filter).The UV cut-off filter was attached to remove UV light and ensure the photocatalysts were activated only by visible light.The mean light intensity of the visible light was determined by an Avantes fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-128) coupled to a cosine corrector.The photocatalyst samples (50 mg) were coated onto glass rods using double-sided tape which were then fixed into quartz tubes.High-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through water before reaching the reactor, forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor in the reactor.The photoreactor was continuously purged for half-an-hour with wet CO 2 , to ensure that the air in the reactor was totally removed and that complete adsorption of gas molecules was achieved.The reactions were then initiated by the xenon light source and the flow rate of CO 2 was held constant at 5 mLmin -1 using a mass flow controller (Brooks 0254 Series).During the photoreactions, the gaseous products were collected downstream, hourly, for a total reaction duration of 10 h and their compositions were analyzed using an inline gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Measuring the gas compositions allowed the measurement of the rates of CH 4 and CO production.The photocatalytic experiments were repeated using an AM1.5 filter attached to the xenon lamp to simulate solar light.The spectra of the visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light are shown in Figs.S1 andS2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at least twice under identical reaction conditions, to ascertain the reproducibility of the results.In all cases, results were consistent; with errors of less than 5.The rate of evolution of CH 4 or CO over 10 h of a lightactivated reaction is shown in Eq. ( 1 C initial and C final denote the initial and final concentrations of CO or CH 4 in the product gas, respectively, V represents the volumetric flow rate of the gaseous products, and m is the mass of photocatalyst used. Photoelectrochemical measurements of the photocatalysts were taken with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N), using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation system.This system comprises a carbon fiber working electrode, with samples covering an active area of 2 cm 2 , a platinum foil as a counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode.For the preparation of the working electrodes, 20 mg of the photocatalyst to be studied was sonicated with 5 mL of ethanol for 5 min to improve the dispersal and homogeneity.The suspension was then drop-cast onto the active area (2 cm 2 ) of the carbon fiber electrode.The fiber was then heated at 150 C for 2 h in an oven, to increase the adhesion of the sample onto the carbon fiber.Meanwhile, a 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution was purged with N 2 for 30 min prior to the PEC measurements, and continuously purged with N 2 during the PEC analyses to eliminate any dissolved O 2 .A water jacket was positioned between the PEC cell system and the xenon arc lamp, to lessen the effects of heat on the Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution during irradiation.For the amperometric measurements, the working electrode was illuminated with a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter attached to remove UV radiation.The transient photocurrent response results were measured with the lamp on and off, under a constant applied bias of 0.5 V. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured over a frequency range of 10 -2 Nano Res. to 10 5 Hz at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an alternating current perturbation signal of 0.01 V under visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Mott-Schottky plots were acquired over a potential range from -1.7 to 0.6 V, with a potential step of 10 mV at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz. We employed a well-established DFT-based ab initio method; the plane-wave projector-augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP).For structural relaxation calculations, the potential with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form, as supplied in the CASTEP was used.For geometry optimization, all forces on the atoms were converged to less than 0.01 eV -1 , the maximum ionic displacement was within 0.001 A and the total stress tensor was reduced to 0.02 GPa.The electronic structures were calculated with a basis set, consisting of the atomic orbitals of C, O, N, and H atoms with a 3 3 1 k-mesh.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "There is no explicit mention of operation mode in the context.", "context": "In summary, we have designed a metal-free 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst, for Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of 0D/2D CND/pCN samples by means of electrostatic attraction.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.
