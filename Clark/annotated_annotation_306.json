Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded at room temperature on a Rigaku diffractometer MiniFlexII/AP using Nifiltered Cu K radiation (30 kV, 15 mA).We used the diffraction line at 2A 33.1 to estimate the mean crystallites size of the CaTiO 3 samples with Scherrer equation, where a diffraction line of Si powder (Kishida) at 28.5 was used as a reference for the determination of the half maximum full-width.Diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-Visible spectrum was recorded at room temperature on a JASCO V-570 equipped with an integrating sphere covered with BaSO 4 , where BaSO 4 was used as the reference.The bandgap was estimated from the spectra according to Tauc plot 32.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was calculated from the amount of N 2 adsorption at 77 K, which was measured by a Quantachrome Monosorb.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were recorded by a JEOL JSM-7500FA or a Hitachi S-5200.The sizes of particles were measured for around 50 particles by a scale on the SEM images, and the average particle size was determined for each sample. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a specially designed reactor of gas-liquid-solid three phases (Fig. 1) under a flow of CO 2 (Taiyo Nippon Sanso, 99.999) gas upon photoirradiation from the bottom (16 cm 2 ) by a 300 W xenon lamp without passing any optical filters, which entirely emitted from UV to visible light, under ambient temperature and pressure.In a quartz cell, 0.2 g of the photocatalyst powder was dispersed in 10 mL of water saturated with 11 mmol of NaHCO 3 (Wako, 99.5).The pH of the solution was 8.3.The mixture of the solution and the photocatalyst powder was photoirradiated with magnetically stirring, where the reaction occurred.The incident light intensity measured in the range of 254 10 nm at the center of the cell was 22 mW cm -2 , and the temperature of the reaction cell became 323 K during the photoirradiation.At regular interval (typically every 1 h), the outlet gas was collected in a sampling column and introduced to an online gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector to determine the amount of H 2 , O 2 and CO.The production rate of H 2 and CO was precisely determined in this method.The amount of O 2 was determined by the subtraction of the amount of air leak into the system, which sometimes contained large error unfortunately.Other products were not observed in this method.Selectivity for CO in the reduced products, S CO was defined as follows: S CO () 100 (production rate of CO)/(sum of production rates of CO and H 2 ).The ratio of the electrons and holes consumed, e -/h was calculated from the production rate as follows: e -/h (sum of production rates of CO and H 2 )/(production rate of O 2 2).", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The operation mode is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred as batch, as the reaction is carried out for a specific time period.", "context": "Each flux, CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl, provided unique morphology of CaTiO 3 particles in the flux method (the molten salt method).Among them, by using the NaCl flux with the moderate concentration of solute, the CaTiO 3 samples consisting of the large polyhedral particles covered with large flat facets and with fewer defects could be prepared. All the samples promoted the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction with water to produce CO and O 2 and water splitting to produce H 2 and O 2 , where the two reactions competitively proceeded.The polyhedral CaTiO 3 photocatalyst with Ag cocatalyst exhibited a high and stable activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which was 10 times higher than the Ag-loaded CaTiO 3 sample prepared by the solid state reaction method.It was revealed that the CO 2 reduction for CO formation take place especially on the Ag cocatalyst, while the water splitting can proceed on the surface of CaTiO 3 photocatalyst.The large flat facets on the polyhedral CaTiO 3 particles of polycrystals would stabilize the Ag nanoparticles to promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO.The most active photocatalyst prepared in the present study was the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample, which exhibited the CO production rate of 0.35 mol h -1 (0.2 g of the photocatalyst with the light of 0.35 W measured in the range of 254 10 nm) and the selectivity for the CO 2 reduction was 45 at the steady state.
