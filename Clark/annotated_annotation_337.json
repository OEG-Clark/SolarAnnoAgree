Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a continuous flow reactor.The catalyst powder (0.14 g) was dispersed in a reactant solution (50 ml) in a down-window type irradiation cell made of Pyrex glass (75 ml).0.2 M potassium bicarbonate aqueous solution was employed as an absorbent for CO 2 .CO 2 was fed continuously into the reactor for 1 h to remove oxygen in water in the dark for 30 min before reaction.Using the cooling system combined with water pump, the temperature of the reactor was maintained at room temperature.The reaction setup is shown in Fig. 2. The light source was a 500 W halogen lamp (Ever bright; H-500) with a light filter cutting the light below 400 nm providing visible light with vertical irradiation.During the photoreaction, samples were collected at a time interval of every 2 h for analysis.The reaction solution was centrifuged to separate the reaction products from the catalyst, and then drawing out 10 mL of the upper stratum for analyzing the constitution.The amount of methanol was determined by a gas chromatography (China Chromatography; GC-8900, Poropack QS column, FID).", "vote": "0"}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "CO 2 was fed continuously into the reactor for 1 h to remove oxygen in water in the dark for 30 min before reaction.", "context": "The polycrystalline InVO 4 was synthesized by solid-state reaction method, as reported in literature 26.The pre-dried In 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 were used as starting materials.The stoichiometric amounts of precursors were mixed and reacted in an aluminum crucible in air at 900 8C for 12 h.The solid mixture was taken out from oven, then grounded and mixed at least 3 times during heating process to ensure homogeneous distribution of In 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 and enhance solid reaction to obtain InVO 4 .NiO co-catalyst was loaded by incipient-wetness impregnation method with aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 on InVO 4 .The samples were calcined at 350 8C for 2 h in air to decompose nitrate and form NiO.
