N,N-bis 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylethylenediamine (EDTMS, 95) was obtained from Gelest.All reagents were used without further purification. Mesoporous silica (SiO 2 ) was synthesized according to previous work by Zhao et al. 35.Two diimine-tricarbonyl Re(I) complexes (4 and 5, Fig. 1) and a dipodal silane coupling agent (EDTMS, denoted \"D\", Fig. 1) were utilized to synthesize hybrid Re(I) photocatalysts by grafting the Re(I) complexes on mesoporous SiO 2 surfaces.The Re(I) complexes feature two derivatized bpy ligands, 2,2 -bipyridine-4,4 -dicarboxylic acid and 2,2 -bipyridine-5,5 -dicarboxylic acid.In a typical synthesis of hybrid Re(I) photocatalysts, 100 mg of mesoporous SiO 2 was dried at 100 C for 2 h and dispersed in 50 ml of dry toluene, to which 75 l EDTMS were added under constant stirring and refluxed for 48 h under nitrogen.The surface functionalized SiO 2 was washed with toluene, diethyl ether, and DCM before collected by centrifugation.In a separate solution, 25 mg 2,2 -bipyridine-4,4 -dicarboxylic acid or 2,2 -bipyridine-5,5 -dicarboxylic acid were dissolved in 10 ml of thionyl chloride.This solution was then refluxed for 12 h and dried under vacuum.The resulting solid was dispersed in 10 ml DCM and was added drop wise under nitrogen to the functionalized SiO 2 which was dispersed in 30 ml of DCM.The combined solution was then refluxed for 12 h and washed with toluene, diethyl ether, and DCM.The resulting product was dispersed in 40 ml of dry toluene, to which 50 mg of pentacarbonylchlororhenium(I) were added.This final solution was refluxed for 12 h under nitrogen and again washed with toluene, diethyl ether, and DCM.The resulting hybrid photocatalyst, denoted as \"4-D-SiO 2 \" or \"5-D-SiO 2 \", was then collected as a yellow powder. Homogenous Re(I) complexes were synthesized according to previous work by Wang et al. 36.The synthesis of 4 started with 1 mmol of 2,2 -bipyridine-4,4 -dicarboxylic acid dispersed in 40 ml of toluene, to which 1 mmol of pentacarbonylchlororhenium(I) was added.The resulting mixture was refluxed for 6 h under nitrogen, and was then stored at 0 C for 1 h.The mixture was purified by filtration and was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 4. The synthesis of 5 was achieved via the same method by mixing 1 mmol 2,2 -bipyridine-5,5 -dicarboxylic acid in 40 ml of m ethanol with 1 mmol of pentacarbonylchlororhenium(I). Optical spectra of synthesized samples were obtained using a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer outfitted with both a transmission cell (for homogeneous solutions) and a Barrelino diffuse reflectance probe (for powder samples).DRIFTS spectra were collected on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory.Elemental analysis of the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts was performed via acid digestion utilizing a Varian Vista AX inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer.EPR spectra were collected on an X-band (9.5 GHz) Bruker ELEXSYS E-500 cw-EPR/ENDOR spectrometer at room temperature. In photocatalytic testing, a certain amount of 4-D-SiO 2 or 5-D-SiO 2 was dispersed in an air-tight pyrex test tube containing 4 ml of DMF and TEOA (volume ratio 3:1).The loading of Re(I) catalysts was controlled to be 0.8 mol in the reaction solution by adjusting the mass of the hybrid photocatalysts.In some experiments, 3 mg of Ru(bpy) 3 2 was added as a photosensitizer to enhance light harvesting in the visible region.The reaction solution was purged with CO 2 (Airgas, 99.999) for 30 min prior to photocatalysis.A Xe arc lamp equipped with a water filter and an AM 1.5 optical filter was used as the light source.For all testing, the light intensity was fixed at 30 mW/cm 2 .While the reaction solution was constantly stirred under light irradiation, the head space was sampled using a gas tight syringe for product analysis using an Agilent 7820 GC equipped with a TCD detector and a 60/80 Carboxen 1000 column.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "simulated solar irradiation", "source": "Fig. 4.
