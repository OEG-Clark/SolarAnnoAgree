Graphite oxide (GO) was prepared by the traditional Hummers method from graphite power (Fig. S2), and the exfoliated GO shows super electronic conductivity because of the -system interruption by substitution with a numerous defects (oxygen functional groups) 48, thus, GO dispersed in ethyl alcohol are strongly adsorbed on the surface of Pt/TiO2 nanocrystals due to surface condensation reaction of oxygen-containing functional groups.Then, GO/(Pt/TiO2) samples was reduced to rGO using NaBH4 solutions 49.Finally, the desired core-shell structured (Pt/TiO2)rGO catalysts with dark gray (Fig. 1b) were obtained after centrifugation, wash and dry in a vacuum oven at 60 o C for 12 h.The catalysts are uniformly named as (Pt/TiO2)rGO-n, where n is the nominal weight percent of rGO to Pt/TiO2 (1, 2, 5 and 10 wt of Pt/TiO2). The morphology and microscopic structure information were obtained on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 200F) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOl JEM 2100) equipped with a field emission source at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm was carried out at -196 o C by using an automated gas sorption analyzer (Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ, USA) after having degassed the sample for 4 h at 300 o C. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The crystal phase properties of all as-prepared samples were analyzed with a powder X-ray diffractometer (Shi-madzu XRD 6000) and a Renishaw Micro-Raman System 2000 spectrometer.The laser line of Raman microscope was 532 nm.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired by a Perkin-ElmerPHI-1600 ESCA spectrometer with Mg Ka emission.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using the Edinburgh Instruments Xe900 equipped with a Xe lamp and the excitation wavelength was set at 380 nm.Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) in the saturated solution of Na2SO4, which has a three-electrode configuration and all as-prepared samples, the saturated Ag/AgCl, a platinum foil were employed to as working photoelectrode, reference and counter electrode, respectively.The samples were illuminated under a 300 W Xe lamp.Temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) measurement was performed on a conventional flow apparatus.Prior to measurements, 100 mg of the sample was pretreated in Ar gas (60 cm 3 min -1 ) at 150 o C for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature.Next, the sample was exposed to CO2 flow of 30 cm 3 min -1 for 0.5 h to ensure the sufficient adsorption of CO2.Before desorption, the sample was flushed in Ar gas for 1 h.Subsequently, CO2 desorption was performed in the range of 30400 o C at a heating spectrometer, which was equipped with a high temperature environmental cell fitted with Zn-Se window and an MCT detector cooled with liquid N2.The catalyst was loaded in the Harrick IR cell and heated to 200 o C under N2 at a flow rate of 50 cm 3 min -1 for 60 min to remove adsorbed impurities.Then the catalyst was cooled down to 30 o C. A background spectrum was collected under a flowing N2 atmosphere and was subtracted from the sample spectra.Next, the sample was exposed to CO2 flow of 50 cm 3 min -1 for 30 min and then under N2 at a flow rate of 50 cm 3 min -1 for 30 min.The in-situ DRIFTS spectra were recorded by accumulating 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm -1 .Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was carried out by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) in order to elucidate relationship between the origin of visible absorption and oxygen defects.The calculations involved on-site Coulomb corrections (DFTU, U 4.2 eV for Ti 3d states).50 PAW pseudopotential was used to describe the core-valence electron interaction.Plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV was used in this work.Anatase TiO2 (001) facet was presented by a five-layer slab model with a vacuum gap of 15 A.For all the surface calculations, the model was a periodic slab with a (22) surface unit cell.A Monkhorst pack 661 k-point mesh was used for the Brillouin zone integration.During structural optimizations, all of the atoms except those in the bottom TiO2 two layers of the slab were allowed to relax until atom forces were smaller than 0.05 eV A -1 . Photocatalytic CO2 reduction test was carried out in a gas-closed circulation system (Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp (320-780 nm).The certain amount of catalysts was uniformly dispersed on a watch-glass with 6.5 cm basal diameter.Before the light irradiation, the photo reactor system was thoroughly vacuum-treated, then CO2 gas was introduced into the circulation system.The deionized water (2 mL) was", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "(Pt/TiO2)rGO-2", "source": "We demonstrated a strategy to fabricate the novel core-shell-structured photocatalysts of (Pt/TiO2)rGO-2 (d), (Pt/TiO2)rGO-5 (e) and (Pt/TiO2)rGO-10 (f) catalysts.", "context": "We demonstrated a strategy to fabricate the novel core-shell-structured photocatalysts of (Pt/TiO2)rGO-2 (d), (Pt/TiO2)rGO-5 (e) and (Pt/TiO2)rGO-10 (f) catalysts.

The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The crystal phase properties of all as-prepared samples were analyzed with a powder X-ray diffractometer (Shi-madzu XRD 6000) and a Renishaw Micro-Raman System 2000 spectrometer.The laser line of Raman microscope was 532 nm.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired by a Perkin-ElmerPHI-1600 ESCA spectrometer with Mg Ka emission.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using the Edinburgh Instruments Xe900 equipped with a Xe lamp and the excitation wavelength was set at 380 nm.Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) in the saturated solution of Na2SO4, which has a three-electrode configuration and all as-prepared samples, the saturated Ag/AgCl, a platinum foil were employed to as working photoelectrode, reference and counter electrode, respectively.The samples were illuminated under a 300 W Xe lamp.Temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) measurement was performed on a conventional flow apparatus.Prior to measurements, 100 mg of the sample was pretreated in Ar gas (60 cm 3 min -1 ) at 150 o C for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature.Next, the sample was exposed to CO2 flow of 30 cm 3 min -1 for 0.5 h to ensure the sufficient adsorption of CO2.Before desorption, the sample was flushed in Ar gas for 1 h.Subsequently, CO2 desorption was performed in the range of 30400 o C at a heating spectrometer, which was equipped with a high temperature environmental cell fitted with Zn-Se window and an MCT detector cooled with liquid N2.The catalyst was loaded in the Harrick IR cell and heated to 200 o C under N2 at a flow rate of 50 cm 3 min -1 for 60 min to remove adsorbed impurities.Then the catalyst was cooled down to 30 o C. A background spectrum was collected under a flowing N2 atmosphere and was subtracted from the sample spectra.Next, the sample was exposed to CO2 flow of 50 cm 3 min -1 for 30 min and then under N2 at a flow rate of 50 cm 3 min -1 for 30 min.The in-situ DRIFTS spectra were recorded by accumulating 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm -1 .Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was carried out by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) in order to elucidate relationship between the origin of visible absorption and oxygen defects.The calculations involved on-site Coulomb corrections (DFTU, U 4.2 eV for Ti 3d states).50 PAW pseudopotential was used to describe the core-valence electron interaction.Plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV was used in this work.Anatase TiO2 (001) facet was presented by a five-layer slab model with a vacuum gap of 15 A.For all the surface calculations, the model was a periodic slab with a (22) surface unit cell.A Monkhorst pack 661 k-point mesh was used for the Brillouin zone integration.During structural optimizations, all of the atoms except those in the bottom TiO2 two layers of the slab were allowed to relax until atom forces were smaller than 0.05 eV A -1 . Photocatalytic CO2 reduction test was carried out in a gas-closed circulation system (Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp (320-780 nm).The certain amount of catalysts was uniformly dispersed on a watch-glass with 6.5 cm basal diameter.Before the light irradiation, the photo reactor system was thoroughly vacuum-treated, then CO2 gas was introduced into the circulation system.The deionized water (2 mL) was", "vote": "0"}]}}
