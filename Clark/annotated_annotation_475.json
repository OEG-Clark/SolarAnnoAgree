Pt and Cu 2 O NPs were co-deposited onto TiO 2 nanocrystals by using a chemical reduction method with the help of NaBH 4 .In a typical process, 1 g TiO 2 nanocrystal powders were dispersed in a 50 mL H 2 PtCl 6 and Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 mixed aqueous solution under stirring for 30 min.The mass ratio of Pt or Cu to TiO 2 is 1.Then 5 mL of mixed solution of NaBH 4 solution (0.1 M) and NaOH solution (0.5 M) were added into the TiO 2 suspension under vigorous stirring for 30 min.After reduction, the solid samples were washed with DI water and collected by centrifugation and drying at 60 C overnight.The obtained sample was donated as Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 .Besides, Pt/TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 were fabricated by dispersing TiO 2 into the metal precursor solution (only H 2 PtCl 6 or Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 ), which is similar to the above-mentioned method. For all samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an Empyrean diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.1542 nm) in the range of 10-80 .The specific surface areas and pore size distribution were measured by a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using an FEI Tecnai G 2 F30 instrument.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W instrument equipped with Al/Mg K radiation.Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were recorded on a confocal laser Raman microscope (Horiba JobinYvon, LabRAM HR800) using a 325 nm excitation light source. In order to verify the behavior of the catalysts in the presence of CO 2 , all samples were analyzed by temperature programmed CO 2 desorption (TPD-CO 2 ).This technique enables us to analyze the types of sites existing in the materials.For the procedures in detail, 50 mg sample of powder was placed into a quartz tube reactor first, which was heated under ultra-high purity He flow (30 mL min -1 ) up to 300 C at a rate of 25 C min -1 for 1 h and then cooled to ambient temperature.After the pretreatment, CO 2 flow (30 mL min -1 ) passed through the catalyst bed for 30 min, subsequently the sample was flushed by He flow (30 mL min -1 ) for 1 h.Finally, the TPD analysis was performed under He flow (30 mL min -1 ) by heating the reactor up to 750 C (Rate: 10 C min -1 ).The effluent gas flow was monitored by a TCD detector.CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under UV light irradiation was carried out in an internal circulated reaction system (as shown in Fig. 1), including a 500 mL Pyrex glass reactor with a quartz window at the top, a 300 W Xe lamp positioned 10 cm above the reactor, and an online gas chromatography (GC).The UV light (300 nm 400 nm, 20.5 mW cm -2 ) was obtained by using a UV light reflector.10 mL of deionized water was added in the bottom of the reactor, and then 20 mg of catalyst powders was placed on a Petri plate positioned 2 cm above the water in the reactor.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first vacuumed by a pump and then was purged and filled by ultra pure CO 2 (99.999).The internal pressure of the reactor was 71 kPa and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 20 C by cooling it with circulating water.The vapor pressure of water was 2.3 kPa under this situation.During 4 h UV light irradiation, the amounts of H 2 , CO, and hydrocarbons in the reactor were analyzed by a GC every 15 min.The GC was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a methanizer.The gaseous sample containing H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , and hydrocarbons flowed through a carbon molecular sieve column (TDX-01) to flush CO 2 back to the atmosphere.After that, H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, and hydrocarbons in the sample were separated by a molecular sieve 5A column.Finally, H 2 , O 2 , and N 2 in the sample were analyzed by the TCD, while CH 4 and CO (converted to CH 4 by a methanizer) were analyzed by the FID.Ar was the carrier gas of GC. Several blank experiments were performed to ensure that any carbon-containing products measured by GC indeed originated from purged CO 2 .First, tests using CO 2 and water as reactants were conducted in the empty reactor.No hydrocarbons were detected in the dark or under light irradiation in this case.This indicated that the CO 2 reduction reaction could not happen in the absence of catalyst.Also, when the reactor was vacuumed (without purged CO 2 ), no hydrocarbons were detected under UV light irradiation in the presence of water and catalyst.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2", "source": "The high CH 4 selectivity of Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 catalysts can be attributed to the co-loading of Cu 2 O and Pt NPs, which enhanced the CO 2 chemisorption and electron density on the surface of TiO 2 simultaneously.", "context": "Pt and Cu 2 O NPs co-depositedTiO 2 nanocrystals with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were prepared through a solvothermal method combining with a NaBH 4 reduction method.Pt remarkably promoted the production of H 2 and CH 4 while suppressed the formation of CO.Cu 2 O enhanced the generation of CH 4 while suppressed the production of H 2 .When Pt and Cu 2 O were co-deposited on TiO 2 crystals, the productions of H 2 and CO were both effectively inhibited and CO 2 was selectively converted into CH 4 (selectivity 96.6).We demonstrated that CH 4 was mainly produced through the direct photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 rather than the hydrogenation of intermediate products such as CO.The deposition of Cu 2 O enhanced the CO 2 chemisorption on TiO 2 and inhibited that of water, resulting in enhanced CO 2 reduction and suppressed H 2 production.The Pt loading captured photogenerated electrons and increased the electrons density on the cocatalysts, which was advantageous to the selective formation of CH 4 .The high CH 4 selectivity of Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 catalysts can be attributed to the co-loading of Cu 2 O and Pt NPs, which enhanced the CO 2 chemisorption and electron density on the surface of TiO 2 simultaneously.

Fig.4Ashows the high-resolution Ti 2p XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 .There exist two peaks in the binding energy region of Ti 2p.The binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for each sample is around 458.6 eV, which indicates Ti 4 in the TiO 223,24.The high-resolution O 1 s XPS spectra of all the samples in Fig.4Bcan be resolved into two peaks.The one with lower energy (around 530.0 eV) is assigned to oxygen in TiO 2 lattice (O L ) and the other (531.5 eV) can be ascribed to superficial oxygen of hydroxyl species (O H ) 17.The O H /O L molar ratio of TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , Cu 2 O/TiO 2 , and Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 were 0.203, 0.243, 0.269, and 0.338, respectively.This information suggests that both deposited Pt and Cu increased the amount of O H on TiO 2 , which may enhance of CO 2 adsorption and its catalytic activity 20,25,26.The high-resolution Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 and Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4C.The Pt 4f region contains two peaks, which can be resolved into two pairs of XPS peaks.The peaks can be attributed to Pt 0 (70.6 eV, 74.1 eV) and Pt 2 (71.4 eV and 75.5 eV) 23,24.The existence of Pt 2 might result from partial oxidation of Pt NPs 27.Meanwhile, the binding energy of Pt 4 almost unchanged, showing the electron density on Pt was not influenced by co-deposited Cu 2 O. Fig. 4D shows the high-resolution Cu 2p XPS spectra of Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 catalysts.The binding energy of Cu 2p 3/2 for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 was ca.932.5 eV, indicating that the Cu species exist as Cu 2 O 19,26.This is in line with the results from TEM. Besides, compared to the peak position of Cu 2 O/TiO 2 catalyst, it is notable that the Cu 2p peaks of Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 shows slight shift to lower binding energy, which implies that Pt promoted the electron migration towards Cu 2 O NPs.The phenomenon also indicated increased electron density on Cu 2 O NPs.PL spectrum was useful for the investigation of electron-hole recombination in semiconductor, which induces fluorescence.The PL spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig.5.Their PL spectra were similar to each other except for different fluorescence intensity.Generally, fluorescence intensity declines in accordance of reduced photogenerated electron-hole recombination28.In our previous work17, we found that the co-exposed 101 and 001 facets of TiO 2 nanocrystals promoted the separation of photogenerated charges because photogenerated electrons on the anatase TiO 2 nanocrystals prefer to migrate to the 101 facets while the photogenerated holes tend to transfer to the 001 facets21,29.In this work, the deposition of Pt and Cu 2 O NPs on TiO 2 nanocrystals both suppressed the PL intensity of TiO 2 nanocrystals.This is because the Pt and Cu 2 O NPs deposited on the 101 facets of TiO 2 crystals can easily capture the photogenerated electrons accumulated on Fig. 3.
