Morphological characterization of the TNT catalysts was performed by FEG-SEM, using a 7500F microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).TEM images were obtained with a TECNAI G2F20 system (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX).The size of gold particles was measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed using a UNI-SPECS UHV system (SPECS, Berlin, Germany) equipped with an Mg Ka X-ray source (h 1253.6eV).The spectra were acquired at a pressure of 10 -7 Pa.The analyzer pass energy was 10 eV and the accuracy of the peak positions was 0.1 eV.The XPS data were corrected using the C1s calibration energy of 284.8 eV.The crystal structure of the catalyst was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction, using a D5000 instrument (Siemens, Munich, Germany) with Cu Ka radiation. A Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Barrelino TM diffuse reflectance accessory (Harrick Scientific, Pleasantville, NY, USA) was used to calculate the optical band gap values of the catalysts.Raman spectra were acquired with a LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France) equipped with a CCD detector (DU420A-OE-325) and a He-Ne laser (632.81 nm).The spectra were obtained between 100 and 1000 cm A1 , with acquisition time of 50 s and 2 cycles.Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectra were obtained in the spectral range from 4000 to 400 cm A1 , using a Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a diamond attenuated total reflectance accessory. Chronoamperometry measurements was performed by the use of a three electrode, with a Pt wire, an Ag/AgCl (4 M) and TNT/ AuNP as the counter-electrode, reference electrode and working electrode, respectively.The transient photocurrent responses were performed in an Autolab PGSTAT 128 N potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) using a 300 W Xe arc lamp with solar filter AM1.5G.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurement was performed using an Autolab PGSTAT 302 N potentiostat (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland).5.0 mM Fe(CN) 6 3A / 4- A in 0.1 M KCl was used as an electrochemical probe.An Ag/AgCl and a Pt wire was used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.The frequency range employed was from 10 kHz to 0.03 Hz, with a 5 mV rms sinusoidal modulation at 0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl.Mott-Schottky analysis was performed to obtain the conduction band position from the impedance potential mode at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7. Photocatalytic experiments were performed using a onecompartment stainless steel reactor with internal capacity of 250 mL (Fig. SM1), filled with 150 mL of Na 2 SO 3 solution (1 g L A1 ) containing CO 2 dissolved by bubbling this gas (Oxi-Ara, Sao Paulo, Brazil) for 20 min, at a flow rate of 1 L min A1 (pH 4.5 after CO 2 bubbling).After bubbling, the reactor was sealed and pressurized with CO 2 , at pressures from 1 to 5 atm.The ILs 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM-BF4) (97) and 1ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate (EMIM-DEP) (98), both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), were used at 1-4 v/v to increase the solubility of CO 2 in water.Na 2 SO 3 was used as a hole scavenger, with its consumption estimated by iodometric titration.Control experiments using nitrogen gas were performed following the same conditions described above.Besides that, isotope labelling experiments were conducted using NaH 13 CO 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as C13 source.In this case, a solution of NaH 13 CO 3 was placed in the reactor with H 2 SO 4 to form 13 CO 2 in situ at approximately 0.033 M (the maximum solubility of CO 2 gas in water at ambient pressure).After that, 2 v/v of BMIM-BF4 was added to the bicarbonate solution and the reactor was sealed. The surface of the catalyst was irradiated using a solar simulator composed of a 300 W Xe arc lamp (type 69911, Newport-Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT, USA), a lamp housing (type 67005, Newport), and solar filter (type 81094, Newport).The solar simulator produced 30 mW cm A2 of irradiance in the range of 280-400 nm, measured using a radiometer (PMA 2100, Solar Light Co., Glenside, PA, USA).The emission spectrum of the solar simulator system was measured with a USB4000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA) (Fig. SM2).In order to evaluate the plasmonic effect of gold NPs, control experiments were performed using TNT/AuNP catalyst under UV irradiation (280-400 nm), using a visible filter (type 66216, Newport) or under irradiation of commercial green light LEDs with 3.0 mW cm A2 of irradiance at the maximum emission of 525 nm (Power Meter, Model 2935-C, Newport).The spectrum of green LEDs was measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (Model Fluorolog-3 FL3-122, Japan) with a laser excitation in 360 nm (Fig. SM2).

The gas phase products were analyzed by GC-TCD (CO and H 2 ) and GC-FID (CH 4 ), using a Carboxen-1010 PLOT fused silica capillary column (30 m A 0.53 mm, 0.30 lm; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and an SH-Rt O -Q-BOND column (30 m A 0.53 mm, 20 lm; Shimadzu, USA), respectively, in a GC 2010 Plus instrument (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).The samples were injected using a twoposition valve (Valco Instruments Co. Inc., Houston, TX, USA).The initial oven temperature was adjusted to 35 C, with a holding time of 7 min.After this period, the temperature was increased to 170 C at 24 C min A1 , with the final temperature maintained for 5 min.The injector temperature was 250 C and the detector temperatures were 200 C (FID) and 180 C (TCD).The carrier gases were Ar (GC-TCD) and N 2 (GC-FID) at flow rates of 3.0 and 96.0 mL min A1 , respectively. Formic acid was analyzed using an ion chromatograph with a conductivity detector (930 Compact IC Flex, Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland), coupled to an autosampler (type 863 Compact IC).Separation was achieved using a Metrosep Organic Acids column (250 mm A 7.8 mm, 8 mm; Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland).Isocratic elution at 0.5 mL min A1 was performed using 0.4 mM H 2 SO 4 as the mobile phase. Labeling carbon 13 products were identified using a GCMS QP2020 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to an AOC 6000 autosampler.The separation was performed using an Zebron ZB-WAX capillary column (15 m A 0.25 mm, 0.25 lm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA).The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min A1 .The injector temperature and heating ramp were the same as used for the GC-FID analysis.The mass spectrometric detector was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode with ionization energy of 70 eV, quadrupole temperature of 150 C, and scanning from m/z 20 to 80. The Au NPs deposited on the TNT substrate were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), using an iCAP 7000 instrument (Thermo Fisher, Madison, WI, USA).The ICP-OES spectrometer operating conditions were as follows: applied radio frequency (RF) power of 1.15 kW; plasma gas flow rate of 12.0 L min A1 (Ar, 99.996; White Martins Praxair, Sao Paulo, Brazil); auxiliary gas flow rate of 0.5 L min A1 ; and nebulizer gas flow rate of 0.5 L min A1 .The Au emission lines used were at 242.8 and 208.2 nm, in axial viewing mode.A calibration curve with linearity from 0.5 to 30.0 mg L A1 was obtained using dilutions of a 1000 mg L A1 stock standard solution of Au in 0.1 mol L A1 HNO 3 .The samples were prepared by chemical pickling, where the TNT/ AuNP catalyst with area of 4.0 cm 2 was immersed in 1.0 mL of 1.0 mol L A1 HNO 3 solution for 15 min, followed by transfer to a 10 mL volumetric flask and completion of the volume with deionized water.

Morphological characterization of the TNT catalysts was performed by FEG-SEM, using a 7500F microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).TEM images were obtained with a TECNAI G2F20 system (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX).The size of gold particles was measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed using a UNI-SPECS UHV system (SPECS, Berlin, Germany) equipped with an Mg Ka X-ray source (h 1253.6eV).The spectra were acquired at a pressure of 10 -7 Pa.The analyzer pass energy was 10 eV and the accuracy of the peak positions was 0.1 eV.The XPS data were corrected using the C1s calibration energy of 284.8 eV.The crystal structure of the catalyst was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction, using a D5000 instrument (Siemens, Munich, Germany) with Cu Ka radiation. A Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Barrelino TM diffuse reflectance accessory (Harrick Scientific, Pleasantville, NY, USA) was used to calculate the optical band gap values of the catalysts.Raman spectra were acquired with a LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France) equipped with a CCD detector (DU420A-OE-325) and a He-Ne laser (632.81 nm).The spectra were obtained between 100 and 1000 cm A1 , with acquisition time of 50 s and 2 cycles.Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectra were obtained in the spectral range from 4000 to 400 cm A1 , using a Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a diamond attenuated total reflectance accessory. Chronoamperometry measurements was performed by the use of a three electrode, with a Pt wire, an Ag/AgCl (4 M) and TNT/ AuNP as the counter-electrode, reference electrode and working electrode, respectively.The transient photocurrent responses were performed in an Autolab PGSTAT 128 N potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) using a 300 W Xe arc lamp with solar filter AM1.5G.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurement was performed using an Autolab PGSTAT 302 N potentiostat (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland).5.0 mM Fe(CN) 6 3A / 4- A in 0.1 M KCl was used as an electrochemical probe.An Ag/AgCl and a Pt wire was used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.The frequency range employed was from 10 kHz to 0.03 Hz, with a 5 mV rms sinusoidal modulation at 0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl.Mott-Schottky analysis was performed to obtain the conduction band position from the impedance potential mode at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7. Photocatalytic experiments were performed using a onecompartment stainless steel reactor with internal capacity of 250 mL (Fig. SM1), filled with 150 mL of Na 2 SO 3 solution (1 g L A1 ) containing CO 2 dissolved by bubbling this gas (Oxi-Ara, Sao Paulo, Brazil) for 20 min, at a flow rate of 1 L min A1 (pH 4.5 after CO 2 bubbling).After bubbling, the reactor was sealed and pressurized with CO 2 , at pressures from 1 to 5 atm.The ILs 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM-BF4) (97) and 1ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate (EMIM-DEP) (98), both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), were used at 1-4 v/v to increase the solubility of CO 2 in water.Na 2 SO 3 was used as a hole scavenger, with its consumption estimated by iodometric titration.Control experiments using nitrogen gas were performed following the same conditions described above.Besides that, isotope labelling experiments were conducted using NaH 13 CO 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as C13 source.In this case, a solution of NaH 13 CO 3 was placed in the reactor with H 2 SO 4 to form 13 CO 2 in situ at approximately 0.033 M (the maximum solubility of CO 2 gas in water at ambient pressure).After that, 2 v/v of BMIM-BF4 was added to the bicarbonate solution and the reactor was sealed. The surface of the catalyst was irradiated using a solar simulator composed of a 300 W Xe arc lamp (type 69911, Newport-Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT, USA), a lamp housing (type 67005, Newport), and solar filter (type 81094, Newport).The solar simulator produced 30 mW cm A2 of irradiance in the range of 280-400 nm, measured using a radiometer (PMA 2100, Solar Light Co., Glenside, PA, USA).The emission spectrum of the solar simulator system was measured with a USB4000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA) (Fig. SM2).In order to evaluate the plasmonic effect of gold NPs, control experiments were performed using TNT/AuNP catalyst under UV irradiation (280-400 nm), using a visible filter (type 66216, Newport) or under irradiation of commercial green light LEDs with 3.0 mW cm A2 of irradiance at the maximum emission of 525 nm (Power Meter, Model 2935-C, Newport).The spectrum of green LEDs was measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (Model Fluorolog-3 FL3-122, Japan) with a laser excitation in 360 nm (Fig. SM2).
