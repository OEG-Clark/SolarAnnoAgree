Thereinto, the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 composite showed much higher photocatalytic activity than the composites with other content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 as well as the nude BiVO 4 or the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The reaction products are methanol and carbon monoxide, the yield of them are up to 16.6 and 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 respectively, which are 12.39 and 5.68 times higher than that of pure BiVO 4 , and 9.88 and 2.80 times higher than that of pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .Such a high activity was ascribed to the type-II heterojunction formed between BiVO Fig. 1a shows XRD pattern of samples at 2 5 80.The diffraction peaks of the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample match with that of tetrahedron phase (JCPDS No. 72-1019).Diffraction peaks of the nude BiVO 4 sample could be indexed to the monoclinic scheelite phase (JCPDS No. 75-1867), and no impurity peaks were observed.These indicate that both the as-prepared Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 are highly pure and high-crystallized.When Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was composited with BiVO 4 , the resulting composites show the diffraction peaks of both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 , and the diffractions of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 become strong and the diffractions of BiVO 4 become weak with increasing content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 ,which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig.1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them. 4 , BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 photocatalysts.All the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction samples are much better than both the pure BiVO 4 and the pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in the photocatalytic activity.Thereinto, BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with 10 mole of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 exhibits the highest activity (CH 3 OH yield 16.6 mol g -1 h -1 , CO yield 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 ), which are 12.39 and 5.68 times that on pure BiVO 4 , or 9.88 and 2.80 times that on pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The two requisite controlling experiments were performed in order to confirm the photocatalytic reaction of samples (Figure S1).For samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , only a trace amount of CO and CH 3 OH was detected under illumination without CO 2 , or without illumination in presence of CO 2 .Importantly, the evolution amount of CO and CH 3 OH are much lower than those in the presence of both illumination and CO 2 , indicating that CO and CH 3 OH products are originated from the photocatalytic reaction of the introduced CO 2 with H 2 O.A BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample was prepared by mechanical mixture of 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with BiVO 4 for comparison.As expected, the photocatalytic activity of the mechanically mixed sample is much lower than that of the hydrothermal samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Figure S2).These experimental results indicate that the hydrothermal loading of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 markedly improves the photocatalytic activity of BiVO 4 for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to CH 3 OH and CO.More importantly, O 2 was detected meanwhile by gas phase chromatography (Figure Fig. 3 shows SEM images of samples BiVO 4 , BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Fig. 2.

Electron structure of BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 Chemical states of the elements in the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 / 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples were analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 5.All spectra were regulated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of surficial deposited carbon.According to the fully scanned spectra (Figure S5), element Bi, Ti, V, O, and C indeed co-exist in BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .From Fig. 5a, the binding energy (BE) of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is respectively 159.00 eV and 164.28 eV for the nude BiVO 4 , while it is 158.79 eV and 164.09 eV for the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , respectively.For the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample, the binding energy of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is in between that of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and that of BiVO 4 but close to that of BiVO 4 .This shows the electron transfer occurring from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which is an indication of heterojunction formation.The asymmetric O 1s XPS peak could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.76 eV and 531.64 eV that are assigned to the surface lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen, respectively (Fig. 5b).For both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12, the Ti 2p peaks have partial overlap with that of Bi 4d 3/2, but the BEs of Ti 2p in the later are lower than that in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Fig. 5c), which are consistent with previous reports 36.This further verifies the electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .According to Fig. 5d, the BEs of V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 (516.76 and 524.27 eV) in the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are slightly higher than that (516.69 and 524.14 eV) in BiVO 4 , which also indicates electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .All the above results suggest that the electrons migrate from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which leads to formation of a heterojunction with built-in electric field direction between BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .

Fig. 9a shows the PL spectra of the two single semiconductors and the composite BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 upon 280 nm light excitation.The lowest PL intensity of the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample indicates the lowest recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which indicates the inhibiting effect of the heterojunction on the photogenerated electron-hole combination.The periodic on/off photocurrent responses of the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples under visible light are displayed in Fig. 9b.The BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample shows stronger photocurrent than both the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and the nude BiVO 4 , which indicates higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample than on the two individual semiconductor components.

Possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O In situ FTIR technology was used to characterize the adsorption states of CO 2 on the sample surface in order to make clear the photocatalytic mechanism.Fig. 10 is the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 before and after the illumination.It can be seen that there is different interaction between CO 2 and the surface of photocatalysts so as to form different surface species before and after illumination.Most notably, BiVO 4 shows much stronger interaction with CO 2 than Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , while the sample BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 shows stronger interaction with CO 2 than both the nude BiVO 4 and the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which can be observed from the IR spectra in the carbonyl region.It is concluded from the IR subtraction spectra that BiVO 4 mainly serves as active sites of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , since CO 2 adsorption bands on BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are more like that on the nude BiVO 4 .Before illumination, CO 2 Fig. 8.

Electron structure of BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 Chemical states of the elements in the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 / 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples were analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 5.All spectra were regulated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of surficial deposited carbon.According to the fully scanned spectra (Figure S5), element Bi, Ti, V, O, and C indeed co-exist in BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .From Fig. 5a, the binding energy (BE) of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is respectively 159.00 eV and 164.28 eV for the nude BiVO 4 , while it is 158.79 eV and 164.09 eV for the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , respectively.For the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample, the binding energy of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is in between that of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and that of BiVO 4 but close to that of BiVO 4 .This shows the electron transfer occurring from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which is an indication of heterojunction formation.The asymmetric O 1s XPS peak could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.76 eV and 531.64 eV that are assigned to the surface lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen, respectively (Fig. 5b).For both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12, the Ti 2p peaks have partial overlap with that of Bi 4d 3/2, but the BEs of Ti 2p in the later are lower than that in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Fig. 5c), which are consistent with previous reports 36.This further verifies the electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .According to Fig. 5d, the BEs of V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 (516.76 and 524.27 eV) in the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are slightly higher than that (516.69 and 524.14 eV) in BiVO 4 , which also indicates electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .All the above results suggest that the electrons migrate from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which leads to formation of a heterojunction with built-in electric field direction between BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .

Fig. 9a shows the PL spectra of the two single semiconductors and the composite BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 upon 280 nm light excitation.The lowest PL intensity of the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample indicates the lowest recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which indicates the inhibiting effect of the heterojunction on the photogenerated electron-hole combination.The periodic on/off photocurrent responses of the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples under visible light are displayed in Fig. 9b.The BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample shows stronger photocurrent than both the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and the nude BiVO 4 , which indicates higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample than on the two individual semiconductor components.

Possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O In situ FTIR technology was used to characterize the adsorption states of CO 2 on the sample surface in order to make clear the photocatalytic mechanism.Fig. 10 is the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 before and after the illumination.It can be seen that there is different interaction between CO 2 and the surface of photocatalysts so as to form different surface species before and after illumination.Most notably, BiVO 4 shows much stronger interaction with CO 2 than Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , while the sample BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 shows stronger interaction with CO 2 than both the nude BiVO 4 and the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which can be observed from the IR spectra in the carbonyl region.It is concluded from the IR subtraction spectra that BiVO 4 mainly serves as active sites of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , since CO 2 adsorption bands on BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are more like that on the nude BiVO 4 .Before illumination, CO 2 Fig. 8.

The molten salt synthesis method was used to prepare Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , where Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 (anatase) were used as raw materials.Since mole ratio of Bi 2 O 3 to TiO 2 is 2:3 in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 were mixed by the stoichiometric amounts.Then, NaCl, KCl and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were mixed at a mole ratio of 60:60:1 and continuously grinded for over 30 min with an agate mortar and pestle.The resulting mixture was then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in Muffle furnace.The mixed NaCl and KCl can be totally melted at 800 C according to the eutectic point, which is the vital steps for the generation of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The resulting white product was washed with deionized water until the ion concentration gets close to zero, followed by overnight drying in an electric oven at 333 K. BiVO 4 nanomaterial was prepared by a simple in situ hydrothermal method.First, 1 mmol bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O) and 0.1 g sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) were separately dissolved in 6 mL and 5 mL of 2 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring to obtain the transparency liquid A. 1 mmol NH 4 VO 3 was dissolved in 6 mL of 2 M nitric acid to obtained the solution B. Then, the solution B was poured quickly into the solution A. A clear orange solution was formed after vigorous stirring, and then to which different molar ratios of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was added.In order to adjust the acid concentration to 1 M, the prepared solution was diluted by a certain amount of de-ionized water.The final resulting 35 mL solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 423 K for 12 h, followed by naturally cooling to room temperature.The final product was gathered by centrifugation, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, followed by desiccation at 60 C in air overnight for further characterization.By the in situ hydrothermal method, BiVO 4 / Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples with different mole ratios (20 mol, 10 mol, and 5 mol ) of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were prepared for comparison.In addition, the nude BiVO 4 as a reference sample was prepared also by the hydrothermal method similar to the above procedure but no adding Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .For simplicity, Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 will be abbreviated as BTO and BiVO 4 done as BVO hereinafter.

Electron structure of BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 Chemical states of the elements in the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 / 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples were analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 5.All spectra were regulated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of surficial deposited carbon.According to the fully scanned spectra (Figure S5), element Bi, Ti, V, O, and C indeed co-exist in BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .From Fig. 5a, the binding energy (BE) of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is respectively 159.00 eV and 164.28 eV for the nude BiVO 4 , while it is 158.79 eV and 164.09 eV for the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , respectively.For the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample, the binding energy of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is in between that of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and that of BiVO 4 but close to that of BiVO 4 .This shows the electron transfer occurring from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which is an indication of heterojunction formation.The asymmetric O 1s XPS peak could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.76 eV and 531.64 eV that are assigned to the surface lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen, respectively (Fig. 5b).For both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12, the Ti 2p peaks have partial overlap with that of Bi 4d 3/2, but the BEs of Ti 2p in the later are lower than that in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Fig. 5c), which are consistent with previous reports 36.This further verifies the electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .According to Fig. 5d, the BEs of V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 (516.76 and 524.27 eV) in the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are slightly higher than that (516.69 and 524.14 eV) in BiVO 4 , which also indicates electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .All the above results suggest that the electrons migrate from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which leads to formation of a heterojunction with built-in electric field direction between BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .

Fig. 9a shows the PL spectra of the two single semiconductors and the composite BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 upon 280 nm light excitation.The lowest PL intensity of the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample indicates the lowest recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which indicates the inhibiting effect of the heterojunction on the photogenerated electron-hole combination.The periodic on/off photocurrent responses of the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples under visible light are displayed in Fig. 9b.The BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample shows stronger photocurrent than both the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and the nude BiVO 4 , which indicates higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample than on the two individual semiconductor components.

Possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O In situ FTIR technology was used to characterize the adsorption states of CO 2 on the sample surface in order to make clear the photocatalytic mechanism.Fig. 10 is the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 before and after the illumination.It can be seen that there is different interaction between CO 2 and the surface of photocatalysts so as to form different surface species before and after illumination.Most notably, BiVO 4 shows much stronger interaction with CO 2 than Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , while the sample BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 shows stronger interaction with CO 2 than both the nude BiVO 4 and the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which can be observed from the IR spectra in the carbonyl region.It is concluded from the IR subtraction spectra that BiVO 4 mainly serves as active sites of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , since CO 2 adsorption bands on BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are more like that on the nude BiVO 4 .Before illumination, CO 2 Fig. 8.

The molten salt synthesis method was used to prepare Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , where Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 (anatase) were used as raw materials.Since mole ratio of Bi 2 O 3 to TiO 2 is 2:3 in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 were mixed by the stoichiometric amounts.Then, NaCl, KCl and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were mixed at a mole ratio of 60:60:1 and continuously grinded for over 30 min with an agate mortar and pestle.The resulting mixture was then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in Muffle furnace.The mixed NaCl and KCl can be totally melted at 800 C according to the eutectic point, which is the vital steps for the generation of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The resulting white product was washed with deionized water until the ion concentration gets close to zero, followed by overnight drying in an electric oven at 333 K. BiVO 4 nanomaterial was prepared by a simple in situ hydrothermal method.First, 1 mmol bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O) and 0.1 g sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) were separately dissolved in 6 mL and 5 mL of 2 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring to obtain the transparency liquid A. 1 mmol NH 4 VO 3 was dissolved in 6 mL of 2 M nitric acid to obtained the solution B. Then, the solution B was poured quickly into the solution A. A clear orange solution was formed after vigorous stirring, and then to which different molar ratios of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was added.In order to adjust the acid concentration to 1 M, the prepared solution was diluted by a certain amount of de-ionized water.The final resulting 35 mL solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 423 K for 12 h, followed by naturally cooling to room temperature.The final product was gathered by centrifugation, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, followed by desiccation at 60 C in air overnight for further characterization.By the in situ hydrothermal method, BiVO 4 / Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples with different mole ratios (20 mol, 10 mol, and 5 mol ) of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were prepared for comparison.In addition, the nude BiVO 4 as a reference sample was prepared also by the hydrothermal method similar to the above procedure but no adding Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .For simplicity, Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 will be abbreviated as BTO and BiVO 4 done as BVO hereinafter. Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu K1 radiation ( 1.5406A) was used to analyze the crystalline phases of the samples.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM 230) was used to observe the morphology.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained via a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.The chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra by a VG ESCALAB 250 XPS System with a monochromatized Al K X-ray source (15 kV, 200 W, 500 m, pass energy 20 eV).All binding energies (BEs) of the spectra were corrected to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of the surficial deposited carbon.UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of the samples were performed with a Cary-500 spectrophotometer, and barium sulfate was used as the reflectance standard.Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were detected at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS 980, excitation wavelength 280 nm).In situ CO 2 -adsorbed FT-IR experiments were implemented on a Nicolet 670 FT-IR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm -1 and 32 scans.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was calculated from the N 2 adsorption isothermal that was determined by a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ-C nitrogen adsorption apparatus.The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried on a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a working electrode (sample), counter electrode (platinum foil) and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode (3.0 M KCl)).The photocurrent with light/dark short-circuit response was recorded by a BAS Epsilon workstation.Sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.2 M) was used as the electrolyte solution.The UV-vis irradiation source was a 300 W Xe lamp.The work functions of BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were determined by Kelvin probe system (SKP5050, KPTechnology Ltd.) with a single-point measurement.Also, the contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample and the tip (gold, 5.1 eV) was measured in the dark.The work function of the tip was initially corrected using a gold disk.The work function of the sample was calculated by the following formula: WF of sample WF of tip CPD The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was carried out in a 270 mL Schlenk flask reactor under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature (298 K).The reactor was equipped with two venting valves and a sampling port sealed with a silicone rubber septum.The light source, a 300 W commercial Xe lamp with a focus intensity of 0.2 W cm -2 (300D, Perfectlight, China), was vertically placed outside the reactor.10 mg photocatalyst powder was dispersed in the bottom of reactor.Subsequently, the reactor was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with pure CO 2 gas at atmospheric pressure.This evacuation-filling operation was repeated several times to remove residual air. 10 L of pure water was injected into the reactor from the silicone rubber septum by a microsyringe and then the photosource was turned on.After 3 h irradiation, 0.5 mL reaction gas was sampled from the reactor and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a chromatographic column (TDX-01).which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig. 1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Xe lamp", "source": "Fig. 2.

Fig. 9a shows the PL spectra of the two single semiconductors and the composite BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 upon 280 nm light excitation.The lowest PL intensity of the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample indicates the lowest recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which indicates the inhibiting effect of the heterojunction on the photogenerated electron-hole combination.The periodic on/off photocurrent responses of the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples under visible light are displayed in Fig. 9b.The BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample shows stronger photocurrent than both the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and the nude BiVO 4 , which indicates higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample than on the two individual semiconductor components.

Possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O In situ FTIR technology was used to characterize the adsorption states of CO 2 on the sample surface in order to make clear the photocatalytic mechanism.Fig. 10 is the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 before and after the illumination.It can be seen that there is different interaction between CO 2 and the surface of photocatalysts so as to form different surface species before and after illumination.Most notably, BiVO 4 shows much stronger interaction with CO 2 than Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , while the sample BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 shows stronger interaction with CO 2 than both the nude BiVO 4 and the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which can be observed from the IR spectra in the carbonyl region.It is concluded from the IR subtraction spectra that BiVO 4 mainly serves as active sites of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , since CO 2 adsorption bands on BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are more like that on the nude BiVO 4 .Before illumination, CO 2 Fig. 8.

The molten salt synthesis method was used to prepare Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , where Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 (anatase) were used as raw materials.Since mole ratio of Bi 2 O 3 to TiO 2 is 2:3 in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 were mixed by the stoichiometric amounts.Then, NaCl, KCl and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were mixed at a mole ratio of 60:60:1 and continuously grinded for over 30 min with an agate mortar and pestle.The resulting mixture was then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in Muffle furnace.The mixed NaCl and KCl can be totally melted at 800 C according to the eutectic point, which is the vital steps for the generation of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The resulting white product was washed with deionized water until the ion concentration gets close to zero, followed by overnight drying in an electric oven at 333 K. BiVO 4 nanomaterial was prepared by a simple in situ hydrothermal method.First, 1 mmol bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O) and 0.1 g sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) were separately dissolved in 6 mL and 5 mL of 2 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring to obtain the transparency liquid A. 1 mmol NH 4 VO 3 was dissolved in 6 mL of 2 M nitric acid to obtained the solution B. Then, the solution B was poured quickly into the solution A. A clear orange solution was formed after vigorous stirring, and then to which different molar ratios of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was added.In order to adjust the acid concentration to 1 M, the prepared solution was diluted by a certain amount of de-ionized water.The final resulting 35 mL solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 423 K for 12 h, followed by naturally cooling to room temperature.The final product was gathered by centrifugation, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, followed by desiccation at 60 C in air overnight for further characterization.By the in situ hydrothermal method, BiVO 4 / Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples with different mole ratios (20 mol, 10 mol, and 5 mol ) of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were prepared for comparison.In addition, the nude BiVO 4 as a reference sample was prepared also by the hydrothermal method similar to the above procedure but no adding Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .For simplicity, Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 will be abbreviated as BTO and BiVO 4 done as BVO hereinafter. Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu K1 radiation ( 1.5406A) was used to analyze the crystalline phases of the samples.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM 230) was used to observe the morphology.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained via a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.The chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra by a VG ESCALAB 250 XPS System with a monochromatized Al K X-ray source (15 kV, 200 W, 500 m, pass energy 20 eV).All binding energies (BEs) of the spectra were corrected to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of the surficial deposited carbon.UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of the samples were performed with a Cary-500 spectrophotometer, and barium sulfate was used as the reflectance standard.Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were detected at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS 980, excitation wavelength 280 nm).In situ CO 2 -adsorbed FT-IR experiments were implemented on a Nicolet 670 FT-IR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm -1 and 32 scans.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was calculated from the N 2 adsorption isothermal that was determined by a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ-C nitrogen adsorption apparatus.The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried on a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a working electrode (sample), counter electrode (platinum foil) and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode (3.0 M KCl)).The photocurrent with light/dark short-circuit response was recorded by a BAS Epsilon workstation.Sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.2 M) was used as the electrolyte solution.The UV-vis irradiation source was a 300 W Xe lamp.The work functions of BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were determined by Kelvin probe system (SKP5050, KPTechnology Ltd.) with a single-point measurement.Also, the contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample and the tip (gold, 5.1 eV) was measured in the dark.The work function of the tip was initially corrected using a gold disk.The work function of the sample was calculated by the following formula: WF of sample WF of tip CPD The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was carried out in a 270 mL Schlenk flask reactor under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature (298 K).The reactor was equipped with two venting valves and a sampling port sealed with a silicone rubber septum.The light source, a 300 W commercial Xe lamp with a focus intensity of 0.2 W cm -2 (300D, Perfectlight, China), was vertically placed outside the reactor.10 mg photocatalyst powder was dispersed in the bottom of reactor.Subsequently, the reactor was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with pure CO 2 gas at atmospheric pressure.This evacuation-filling operation was repeated several times to remove residual air. 10 L of pure water was injected into the reactor from the silicone rubber septum by a microsyringe and then the photosource was turned on.After 3 h irradiation, 0.5 mL reaction gas was sampled from the reactor and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a chromatographic column (TDX-01).which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig. 1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The composite photocatalyst showed superior activity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with pure H 2 O.", "context": "A novel BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction composite was successfully designed and synthesized via a facile in situ hydrothermal approach.The composite photocatalyst showed superior activity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with pure H 2 O. Thereinto, the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 composite showed much higher photocatalytic activity than the composites with other content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 as well as the nude BiVO 4 or the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The reaction products are methanol and carbon monoxide, the yield of them are up to 16.6 and 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 respectively, which are 12.39 and 5.68 times higher than that of pure BiVO 4 , and 9.88 and 2.80 times higher than that of pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .Such a high activity was ascribed to the type-II heterojunction formed between BiVO Fig. 1a shows XRD pattern of samples at 2 5 80.The diffraction peaks of the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample match with that of tetrahedron phase (JCPDS No. 72-1019).Diffraction peaks of the nude BiVO 4 sample could be indexed to the monoclinic scheelite phase (JCPDS No. 75-1867), and no impurity peaks were observed.These indicate that both the as-prepared Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 are highly pure and high-crystallized.When Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was composited with BiVO 4 , the resulting composites show the diffraction peaks of both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 , and the diffractions of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 become strong and the diffractions of BiVO 4 become weak with increasing content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 ,which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig.1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them. 4 , BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 photocatalysts.All the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction samples are much better than both the pure BiVO 4 and the pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in the photocatalytic activity.Thereinto, BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with 10 mole of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 exhibits the highest activity (CH 3 OH yield 16.6 mol g -1 h -1 , CO yield 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 ), which are 12.39 and 5.68 times that on pure BiVO 4 , or 9.88 and 2.80 times that on pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The two requisite controlling experiments were performed in order to confirm the photocatalytic reaction of samples (Figure S1).For samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , only a trace amount of CO and CH 3 OH was detected under illumination without CO 2 , or without illumination in presence of CO 2 .Importantly, the evolution amount of CO and CH 3 OH are much lower than those in the presence of both illumination and CO 2 , indicating that CO and CH 3 OH products are originated from the photocatalytic reaction of the introduced CO 2 with H 2 O.A BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample was prepared by mechanical mixture of 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with BiVO 4 for comparison.As expected, the photocatalytic activity of the mechanically mixed sample is much lower than that of the hydrothermal samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Figure S2).These experimental results indicate that the hydrothermal loading of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 markedly improves the photocatalytic activity of BiVO 4 for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to CH 3 OH and CO.More importantly, O 2 was detected meanwhile by gas phase chromatography (Figure Fig. 3 shows SEM images of samples BiVO 4 , BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Fig. 2.

Possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O In situ FTIR technology was used to characterize the adsorption states of CO 2 on the sample surface in order to make clear the photocatalytic mechanism.Fig. 10 is the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 before and after the illumination.It can be seen that there is different interaction between CO 2 and the surface of photocatalysts so as to form different surface species before and after illumination.Most notably, BiVO 4 shows much stronger interaction with CO 2 than Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , while the sample BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 shows stronger interaction with CO 2 than both the nude BiVO 4 and the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which can be observed from the IR spectra in the carbonyl region.It is concluded from the IR subtraction spectra that BiVO 4 mainly serves as active sites of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , since CO 2 adsorption bands on BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are more like that on the nude BiVO 4 .Before illumination, CO 2 Fig. 8.

The molten salt synthesis method was used to prepare Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , where Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 (anatase) were used as raw materials.Since mole ratio of Bi 2 O 3 to TiO 2 is 2:3 in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 were mixed by the stoichiometric amounts.Then, NaCl, KCl and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were mixed at a mole ratio of 60:60:1 and continuously grinded for over 30 min with an agate mortar and pestle.The resulting mixture was then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in Muffle furnace.The mixed NaCl and KCl can be totally melted at 800 C according to the eutectic point, which is the vital steps for the generation of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The resulting white product was washed with deionized water until the ion concentration gets close to zero, followed by overnight drying in an electric oven at 333 K. BiVO 4 nanomaterial was prepared by a simple in situ hydrothermal method.First, 1 mmol bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O) and 0.1 g sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) were separately dissolved in 6 mL and 5 mL of 2 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring to obtain the transparency liquid A. 1 mmol NH 4 VO 3 was dissolved in 6 mL of 2 M nitric acid to obtained the solution B. Then, the solution B was poured quickly into the solution A. A clear orange solution was formed after vigorous stirring, and then to which different molar ratios of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was added.In order to adjust the acid concentration to 1 M, the prepared solution was diluted by a certain amount of de-ionized water.The final resulting 35 mL solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 423 K for 12 h, followed by naturally cooling to room temperature.The final product was gathered by centrifugation, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, followed by desiccation at 60 C in air overnight for further characterization.By the in situ hydrothermal method, BiVO 4 / Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples with different mole ratios (20 mol, 10 mol, and 5 mol ) of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were prepared for comparison.In addition, the nude BiVO 4 as a reference sample was prepared also by the hydrothermal method similar to the above procedure but no adding Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .For simplicity, Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 will be abbreviated as BTO and BiVO 4 done as BVO hereinafter. Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu K1 radiation ( 1.5406A) was used to analyze the crystalline phases of the samples.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM 230) was used to observe the morphology.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained via a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.The chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra by a VG ESCALAB 250 XPS System with a monochromatized Al K X-ray source (15 kV, 200 W, 500 m, pass energy 20 eV).All binding energies (BEs) of the spectra were corrected to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of the surficial deposited carbon.UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of the samples were performed with a Cary-500 spectrophotometer, and barium sulfate was used as the reflectance standard.Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were detected at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS 980, excitation wavelength 280 nm).In situ CO 2 -adsorbed FT-IR experiments were implemented on a Nicolet 670 FT-IR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm -1 and 32 scans.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was calculated from the N 2 adsorption isothermal that was determined by a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ-C nitrogen adsorption apparatus.The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried on a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a working electrode (sample), counter electrode (platinum foil) and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode (3.0 M KCl)).The photocurrent with light/dark short-circuit response was recorded by a BAS Epsilon workstation.Sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.2 M) was used as the electrolyte solution.The UV-vis irradiation source was a 300 W Xe lamp.The work functions of BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were determined by Kelvin probe system (SKP5050, KPTechnology Ltd.) with a single-point measurement.Also, the contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample and the tip (gold, 5.1 eV) was measured in the dark.The work function of the tip was initially corrected using a gold disk.The work function of the sample was calculated by the following formula: WF of sample WF of tip CPD The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was carried out in a 270 mL Schlenk flask reactor under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature (298 K).The reactor was equipped with two venting valves and a sampling port sealed with a silicone rubber septum.The light source, a 300 W commercial Xe lamp with a focus intensity of 0.2 W cm -2 (300D, Perfectlight, China), was vertically placed outside the reactor.10 mg photocatalyst powder was dispersed in the bottom of reactor.Subsequently, the reactor was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with pure CO 2 gas at atmospheric pressure.This evacuation-filling operation was repeated several times to remove residual air. 10 L of pure water was injected into the reactor from the silicone rubber septum by a microsyringe and then the photosource was turned on.After 3 h irradiation, 0.5 mL reaction gas was sampled from the reactor and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a chromatographic column (TDX-01).which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig. 1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "A novel BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction composite was successfully designed and synthesized via a facile in situ hydrothermal approach.", "context": "A novel BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction composite was successfully designed and synthesized via a facile in situ hydrothermal approach.The composite photocatalyst showed superior activity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with pure H 2 O. Thereinto, the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 composite showed much higher photocatalytic activity than the composites with other content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 as well as the nude BiVO 4 or the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The reaction products are methanol and carbon monoxide, the yield of them are up to 16.6 and 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 respectively, which are 12.39 and 5.68 times higher than that of pure BiVO 4 , and 9.88 and 2.80 times higher than that of pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .Such a high activity was ascribed to the type-II heterojunction formed between BiVO Fig. 1a shows XRD pattern of samples at 2 5 80.The diffraction peaks of the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample match with that of tetrahedron phase (JCPDS No. 72-1019).Diffraction peaks of the nude BiVO 4 sample could be indexed to the monoclinic scheelite phase (JCPDS No. 75-1867), and no impurity peaks were observed.These indicate that both the as-prepared Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 are highly pure and high-crystallized.When Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was composited with BiVO 4 , the resulting composites show the diffraction peaks of both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 , and the diffractions of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 become strong and the diffractions of BiVO 4 become weak with increasing content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 ,which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig.1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them. 4 , BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 photocatalysts.All the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction samples are much better than both the pure BiVO 4 and the pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in the photocatalytic activity.Thereinto, BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with 10 mole of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 exhibits the highest activity (CH 3 OH yield 16.6 mol g -1 h -1 , CO yield 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 ), which are 12.39 and 5.68 times that on pure BiVO 4 , or 9.88 and 2.80 times that on pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The two requisite controlling experiments were performed in order to confirm the photocatalytic reaction of samples (Figure S1).For samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , only a trace amount of CO and CH 3 OH was detected under illumination without CO 2 , or without illumination in presence of CO 2 .Importantly, the evolution amount of CO and CH 3 OH are much lower than those in the presence of both illumination and CO 2 , indicating that CO and CH 3 OH products are originated from the photocatalytic reaction of the introduced CO 2 with H 2 O.A BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample was prepared by mechanical mixture of 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with BiVO 4 for comparison.As expected, the photocatalytic activity of the mechanically mixed sample is much lower than that of the hydrothermal samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Figure S2).These experimental results indicate that the hydrothermal loading of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 markedly improves the photocatalytic activity of BiVO 4 for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to CH 3 OH and CO.More importantly, O 2 was detected meanwhile by gas phase chromatography (Figure Fig. 3 shows SEM images of samples BiVO 4 , BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Fig. 2.

Electron structure of BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 Chemical states of the elements in the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 / 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples were analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 5.All spectra were regulated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of surficial deposited carbon.According to the fully scanned spectra (Figure S5), element Bi, Ti, V, O, and C indeed co-exist in BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .From Fig. 5a, the binding energy (BE) of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is respectively 159.00 eV and 164.28 eV for the nude BiVO 4 , while it is 158.79 eV and 164.09 eV for the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , respectively.For the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample, the binding energy of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is in between that of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and that of BiVO 4 but close to that of BiVO 4 .This shows the electron transfer occurring from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which is an indication of heterojunction formation.The asymmetric O 1s XPS peak could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.76 eV and 531.64 eV that are assigned to the surface lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen, respectively (Fig. 5b).For both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12, the Ti 2p peaks have partial overlap with that of Bi 4d 3/2, but the BEs of Ti 2p in the later are lower than that in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Fig. 5c), which are consistent with previous reports 36.This further verifies the electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .According to Fig. 5d, the BEs of V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 (516.76 and 524.27 eV) in the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are slightly higher than that (516.69 and 524.14 eV) in BiVO 4 , which also indicates electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .All the above results suggest that the electrons migrate from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which leads to formation of a heterojunction with built-in electric field direction between BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .

Fig. 8a is SEM images of the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample after only photodeposition of Pt by UV irradiating the suspension solution with the sample and chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O).Fig. 8b is SEM images of BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , after co-photodeposition of Pt and MnOx by UV irradiating the suspension with BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O and MnCl 2 .By comparison of the deposited species images on the two images, we could distinguish clearly that Pt particles (bright specks) and MnO x particles (dark Fig. 4.

Fig. 9a shows the PL spectra of the two single semiconductors and the composite BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 upon 280 nm light excitation.The lowest PL intensity of the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample indicates the lowest recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which indicates the inhibiting effect of the heterojunction on the photogenerated electron-hole combination.The periodic on/off photocurrent responses of the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples under visible light are displayed in Fig. 9b.The BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample shows stronger photocurrent than both the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and the nude BiVO 4 , which indicates higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample than on the two individual semiconductor components.

Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu K1 radiation ( 1.5406A) was used to analyze the crystalline phases of the samples.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM 230) was used to observe the morphology.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained via a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.The chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra by a VG ESCALAB 250 XPS System with a monochromatized Al K X-ray source (15 kV, 200 W, 500 m, pass energy 20 eV).All binding energies (BEs) of the spectra were corrected to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of the surficial deposited carbon.UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of the samples were performed with a Cary-500 spectrophotometer, and barium sulfate was used as the reflectance standard.Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were detected at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS 980, excitation wavelength 280 nm).In situ CO 2 -adsorbed FT-IR experiments were implemented on a Nicolet 670 FT-IR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm -1 and 32 scans.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was calculated from the N 2 adsorption isothermal that was determined by a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ-C nitrogen adsorption apparatus.The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried on a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a working electrode (sample), counter electrode (platinum foil) and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode (3.0 M KCl)).The photocurrent with light/dark short-circuit response was recorded by a BAS Epsilon workstation.Sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.2 M) was used as the electrolyte solution.The UV-vis irradiation source was a 300 W Xe lamp.The work functions of BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were determined by Kelvin probe system (SKP5050, KPTechnology Ltd.) with a single-point measurement.Also, the contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample and the tip (gold, 5.1 eV) was measured in the dark.The work function of the tip was initially corrected using a gold disk.The work function of the sample was calculated by the following formula: WF of sample WF of tip CPD The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was carried out in a 270 mL Schlenk flask reactor under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature (298 K).The reactor was equipped with two venting valves and a sampling port sealed with a silicone rubber septum.The light source, a 300 W commercial Xe lamp with a focus intensity of 0.2 W cm -2 (300D, Perfectlight, China), was vertically placed outside the reactor.10 mg photocatalyst powder was dispersed in the bottom of reactor.Subsequently, the reactor was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with pure CO 2 gas at atmospheric pressure.This evacuation-filling operation was repeated several times to remove residual air. 10 L of pure water was injected into the reactor from the silicone rubber septum by a microsyringe and then the photosource was turned on.After 3 h irradiation, 0.5 mL reaction gas was sampled from the reactor and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a chromatographic column (TDX-01).which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig. 1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Not mentioned", "source": "The text does not explicitly mention the operation mode.", "context": "A novel BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction composite was successfully designed and synthesized via a facile in situ hydrothermal approach.The composite photocatalyst showed superior activity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with pure H 2 O. Thereinto, the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 composite showed much higher photocatalytic activity than the composites with other content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 as well as the nude BiVO 4 or the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The reaction products are methanol and carbon monoxide, the yield of them are up to 16.6 and 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 respectively, which are 12.39 and 5.68 times higher than that of pure BiVO 4 , and 9.88 and 2.80 times higher than that of pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .Such a high activity was ascribed to the type-II heterojunction formed between BiVO Fig. 1a shows XRD pattern of samples at 2 5 80.The diffraction peaks of the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample match with that of tetrahedron phase (JCPDS No. 72-1019).Diffraction peaks of the nude BiVO 4 sample could be indexed to the monoclinic scheelite phase (JCPDS No. 75-1867), and no impurity peaks were observed.These indicate that both the as-prepared Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 are highly pure and high-crystallized.When Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was composited with BiVO 4 , the resulting composites show the diffraction peaks of both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 , and the diffractions of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 become strong and the diffractions of BiVO 4 become weak with increasing content of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 ,which could be seen clearly from the XRD peaks at 2 28 31(Fig.1b).It's worth noting that a new diffraction peak appears at 2 11.9withincreasing BTO content (Fig.1b).These show that both BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 keep their respective crystal phase in their composite, and there is interaction occurring at the interface between them. 4 , BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 photocatalysts.All the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction samples are much better than both the pure BiVO 4 and the pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in the photocatalytic activity.Thereinto, BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with 10 mole of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 exhibits the highest activity (CH 3 OH yield 16.6 mol g -1 h -1 , CO yield 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 ), which are 12.39 and 5.68 times that on pure BiVO 4 , or 9.88 and 2.80 times that on pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The two requisite controlling experiments were performed in order to confirm the photocatalytic reaction of samples (Figure S1).For samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , only a trace amount of CO and CH 3 OH was detected under illumination without CO 2 , or without illumination in presence of CO 2 .Importantly, the evolution amount of CO and CH 3 OH are much lower than those in the presence of both illumination and CO 2 , indicating that CO and CH 3 OH products are originated from the photocatalytic reaction of the introduced CO 2 with H 2 O.A BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample was prepared by mechanical mixture of 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 with BiVO 4 for comparison.As expected, the photocatalytic activity of the mechanically mixed sample is much lower than that of the hydrothermal samples BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Figure S2).These experimental results indicate that the hydrothermal loading of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 markedly improves the photocatalytic activity of BiVO 4 for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to CH 3 OH and CO.More importantly, O 2 was detected meanwhile by gas phase chromatography (Figure Fig. 3 shows SEM images of samples BiVO 4 , BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Fig. 2.

Electron structure of BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 Chemical states of the elements in the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 / 10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples were analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 5.All spectra were regulated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of surficial deposited carbon.According to the fully scanned spectra (Figure S5), element Bi, Ti, V, O, and C indeed co-exist in BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .From Fig. 5a, the binding energy (BE) of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is respectively 159.00 eV and 164.28 eV for the nude BiVO 4 , while it is 158.79 eV and 164.09 eV for the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , respectively.For the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample, the binding energy of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 is in between that of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and that of BiVO 4 but close to that of BiVO 4 .This shows the electron transfer occurring from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which is an indication of heterojunction formation.The asymmetric O 1s XPS peak could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.76 eV and 531.64 eV that are assigned to the surface lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen, respectively (Fig. 5b).For both Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12, the Ti 2p peaks have partial overlap with that of Bi 4d 3/2, but the BEs of Ti 2p in the later are lower than that in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (Fig. 5c), which are consistent with previous reports 36.This further verifies the electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .According to Fig. 5d, the BEs of V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 (516.76 and 524.27 eV) in the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are slightly higher than that (516.69 and 524.14 eV) in BiVO 4 , which also indicates electron transfer from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .All the above results suggest that the electrons migrate from BiVO 4 to Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 in BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which leads to formation of a heterojunction with built-in electric field direction between BiVO 4 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 . Fig. 3.

Fig. 9a shows the PL spectra of the two single semiconductors and the composite BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 upon 280 nm light excitation.The lowest PL intensity of the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample indicates the lowest recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which indicates the inhibiting effect of the heterojunction on the photogenerated electron-hole combination.The periodic on/off photocurrent responses of the BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples under visible light are displayed in Fig. 9b.The BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample shows stronger photocurrent than both the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and the nude BiVO 4 , which indicates higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample than on the two individual semiconductor components.

Possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O In situ FTIR technology was used to characterize the adsorption states of CO 2 on the sample surface in order to make clear the photocatalytic mechanism.Fig. 10 is the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 , Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 before and after the illumination.It can be seen that there is different interaction between CO 2 and the surface of photocatalysts so as to form different surface species before and after illumination.Most notably, BiVO 4 shows much stronger interaction with CO 2 than Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , while the sample BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 shows stronger interaction with CO 2 than both the nude BiVO 4 and the nude Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which can be observed from the IR spectra in the carbonyl region.It is concluded from the IR subtraction spectra that BiVO 4 mainly serves as active sites of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , since CO 2 adsorption bands on BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 are more like that on the nude BiVO 4 .Before illumination, CO 2 Fig. 8.
