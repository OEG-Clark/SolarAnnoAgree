coated on 5 mm o.d. and 7 mm long hollow glass beads.The coating procedure of thin and thick films slightly varied.Thick film coating procedure was described in detail elsewhere 23.For thin film preparation tetra isopropyl ortho titanate (Merck) was used as Ti source.Isopropanol, acetic acid and water were used as solvent, modifier and hydrolyser, respectively.Water amount is very important for sol-gel synthesis technique since it determines the gellation time.The synthesis procedure requires the sol to be stable, i.e. not to gellate, at least for 6 h.To determine the best recipe, which would be stable during the whole procedure, water to tetra isopropyl ortho titanate ratio was selected after several trials and used throughout the study.The sol for TiO 2 coating was prepared by mixing tetra isopropyl ortho titanate, isopropanol, acetic acid and water with following volumetric ratio (6:120:2.5:1).To obtain a more stable sol, water and acetic acid was firstly mixed with half volume of required isopropanol and added to the tetra isopropyl ortho titanate-isopropanol mixture afterwards.Addition was done slowly and the mixture was stirred continuously to provide a good mixing and to prevent local gellation.The coating was established by dipping the beads into the sol with a dipping rate of 7.5 cm/min, waiting for 10 min and pulling them with the same speed.The beads were then dried at 120 8C in air, and calcined at 400 8C for 30 min.This procedure was repeated for three times for a successful coating.Further details of Pt and dye sensitizer (Table 1) addition and details of the reaction set up and methodology can be found in the previous articles 23,24.The film thicknesses were measured from films coated on flat microscope glasses by a DEKTAK profilometer. The reaction tests were performed under UVand visible light illumination.For UV tests a 150 W UVA lamp was used, for visible light tests a 75 W daylight lamp was used.Measurements were taken at 60th, 120th and 180th min of the test run.The products of reaction tests of thin films were analyzed using a HP-4890/A GC equipped with 6 0 Porapak Q column.For the reaction tests with thick films, Varian 3900 GC equipped with Poraplot Q capillary column was used.The settings applied during the experiments are given in Table 2.The results are reported as micromoles of methane produced per gram catalyst.The average weight of the catalysts was determined from a controlled batch.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The reaction tests were performed under UVand visible light illumination.", "context": "Thin and thick films of TiO 2 were coated on 5 mm o.d. and 7 mm long hollow glass beads.The coating procedure of thin and thick films slightly varied.Thick film coating procedure was described in detail elsewhere 23.For thin film preparation tetra isopropyl ortho titanate (Merck) was used as Ti source.Isopropanol, acetic acid and water were used as solvent, modifier and hydrolyser, respectively.Water amount is very important for sol-gel synthesis technique since it determines the gellation time.The synthesis procedure requires the sol to be stable, i.e. not to gellate, at least for 6 h.To determine the best recipe, which would be stable during the whole procedure, water to tetra isopropyl ortho titanate ratio was selected after several trials and used throughout the study.The sol for TiO 2 coating was prepared by mixing tetra isopropyl ortho titanate, isopropanol, acetic acid and water with following volumetric ratio (6:120:2.5:1).To obtain a more stable sol, water and acetic acid was firstly mixed with half volume of required isopropanol and added to the tetra isopropyl ortho titanate-isopropanol mixture afterwards.Addition was done slowly and the mixture was stirred continuously to provide a good mixing and to prevent local gellation.The coating was established by dipping the beads into the sol with a dipping rate of 7.5 cm/min, waiting for 10 min and pulling them with the same speed.The beads were then dried at 120 8C in air, and calcined at 400 8C for 30 min.This procedure was repeated for three times for a successful coating.Further details of Pt and dye sensitizer (Table 1) addition and details of the reaction set up and methodology can be found in the previous articles 23,24.The film thicknesses were measured from films coated on flat microscope glasses by a DEKTAK profilometer.
