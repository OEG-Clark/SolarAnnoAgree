The XRD experiments were preformed using a Siemens D-500 powder diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 41 mA), 0.024step size and 1 s step time from 5to 90.The Bragg-Brentano focusing geometry was employed with an automatic divergence slit (irradiated sample length was 12.5 nm), a receiving slit of 0.1 nm, a fixed slit of 4a nd a proportional counter as a detector. Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained with a Hitachi S-800 field emission microscope using an acceleration voltage of 20 kV.Samples were placed on a stage especially made for SEM.Samples were coated with Au prior to analysis and imaged directly.SEM images were recorded at magnification of 5000 and 10000.The magnification was calibrated in pixel/nm on the camera.The chemical composition of the samples was determined by X-ray energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) with accelerating voltage of 20 kV.
