Fig. 13b.The EIS response demonstrated the S400 composite photocatalysts possessed a smaller impedance radius compared with other composites.The EIS response demonstrated the V 2 O 5 /ZnV 2 O 6 composite photocatalysts display a smaller semicircle in the Nyquist plot than that of pure V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 , which further confirms the elevated conductivity of the hybrid and the superiority of hierarchical heterojunction nanosheet structure in promoting a faster charge carriers' migration.This is consistent with the PL result.It is also consistent with the theoretical calculation that the electrons transfer from ZnV 2 O 6 to V 2 O 5 (electrons gather on V 2 O 5 and holes on ZnV 2 O 6 ), which enhances the charge transfer and separation.
