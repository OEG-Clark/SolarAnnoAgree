Carbon dioxide, O 2 , Argon and Helium were with purity of 99.99, a gas burette (Figure S1) was used to measure gas volume in adsorption/desorption experiments.Formic and acetic acid analyses were performed with an Ion Chromatograph Dionex DX120 (Ion Pac ICE-AS6 Analytical Column, Monza, Italy); 0.8 mM heptafluorobutyric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as eluent (flow 1.00 mL/min) and 5.0 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as regenerating eluent (flow 4.5 mL/min). Formic acid 99 and acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich) were employed as standard for building IC calibration curves.Analyses were carried out by using a sample loop of 25 L, with a column pressure less than 640 PSI and a background of 35-40 S. GC analyses for liquid and gas phase were performed with a GC Tracera Shimadzu 2010 (Milan, Italy) with a Detector BID-2010 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) plus and a Micropacked ST column (temperature program isotherm at 40 C 30 min).Infrared analyses were performed in the range 400-4000 cm -1 (64 scans), using a PerkinElmer 2000 FT-IR spectrometer (Milan, Italy). Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, GA, USA) using a flowing nitrogen atmosphere.The samples (about 1 mg per sample) were equilibrated at 100 C for 20 min and then heated at a rate of 10 C min -1 up to 800 C. Elemental analyses were performed on a Thermo Flash EA 1112 series CHNS-O elemental analyzer (Monza, Italy) with an accepted tolerance of 0.4 units. TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analyses were performed with a TEM Philips EM208 instrument (Vienna, Austria) using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.The samples were prepared by dropping aliquots of the DMF dispersions onto TEM grids (200 mesh, Nichel, carbon only, Ted Pella, Milan, Italy). BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface area was obtained by N 2 adsorption-desorption method on powder samples using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics, Norcross, U.S.A.).The samples (500 mg) were pre-treated at 80 C for 2 h before N 2 adsorption.FE-SEM investigations were performed by a Zeiss Sigma (Milan, Italy) microscope operating in the range 0.5-20 kV and equipped with an in-lens secondary electron detector.FE-SEM samples were prepared by sticking the powder on double sided carbon tape.Samples were mounted onto stainless-steel sample holders by using and grounded by silver paste. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR Cary 5 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (BaSO 4 ). X-Ray powder diffraction data were collected at room temperature by using an automated Rigaku RINT2500 laboratory diffractometer (50 KV, 200 mA, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) equipped with the silicon strip Rigaku D/teX Ultra detector.Detailed XRD analyses of hybrids nanocomposites are showed in Figure S2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer (Phisical Electronics, Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at a spot size of 100 m, corresponding to a power of 24.4 W. Survey (0-1400 eV) and high resolution (C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p, Cl 2p, F 1s) spectra were recorded in FAT (fixed analyzer transmission) mode at pass energy of 117.4 eV and 46.95 eV, respectively.All spectra were acquired at a take-off angle of 45 with respect to the sample normal.Dual-beam charge neutralization was constantly applied during analysis.Charge correction of the spectra was performed by taking the sp2 graphitic component of the C 1s spectrum as internal reference (binding energy, BE 284.6 eV). XPS analysis was repeated on three different spots for each sample.During analyses, special care was devoted to verifying that no change in the samples was induced by exposure to the X-ray beam and the charge neutralization dual-beam.Detailed spectra processing was performed by commercial MultiPak software (Version 9.5.0.8, 30-10-2013, Ulvac-PHI, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan).The high-resolution spectra were fitted with mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian peaks after a Shirley background subtraction. The DO 9721 quantum photo-radiometer (Delta Ohm, Pordenone, Italy) and thermometer data logger were used for measuring illuminance, irradiance, luminance and temperature. Preparation was accomplished according to our previous method 41,42.MWCNTs (600-1000 mg) were placed in CH 2 Cl 2 (50-100 mL) and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min.An aliquot (35 mmol) of the standardized cold solution of methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO, 70 mL, 0.5 M) in 1,1,1-trifluoropropanone (TFP), was then added in one portion to the mixture, which was stirred and kept at 0 C.After 24 h the reaction was complete, the mixture was filtered, and ox-CNTs 2 were washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH, with recovery of 700-1300 mg. This procedure was used for preparation of amine grafted-MWCNTs 3 and 4 41,42.Oxidized nanotubes 2 (1 g) were dispersed in 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (3.7 g) or branched polyethylenimine (5 g PEI MW 600, 99 of purity) and the mixture was heated at reflux at 140 C under N 2 for 12 h.Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (20 mL) and filtered through a PTFE membrane filter paper (0.2 m).The solid was washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH to remove any excess of amine leading to HMDA-MWCNTs (3, 1.20 g) or PEI -MWCNTs (4, 1.25 g).Elemental analyses for 3: C (95.45), H (3.24), O (0.30), N (1.01); for 4: C (91.59), H (5.61), O (0.17), N (2.63). Preparation of hybrids nanocomposites was accomplished to previous method 14, titanium tetrachloride (98 TiCl 4 ), hydrochloric acid (38 HCl) and distilled water with a molar ratio of TiCl 4 :HCl:H 2 O 0.1:1:200 were homogenized under magnetic stirring for 30 min.The thus obtained transparent mother solution was then used as the raw material for preparing nanocomposites for photocatalytic experiments.Proper amounts of both p-MWCNTs (1) and functionalized PEI-MWCNTs (4) were separately dispersed into the proper volume of mother solution according to Table 1.After suspension, mixture was sonicated and then ammonia was slowly added (until neutrality) under vigorous stirring, thus inducing TiO 2 precipitation and formation of random agglomerates by inclusion of CNTs 14.After filtration, nanocomposites 1A, 1C and 4A-C were washed with distilled water and dried at 80 C for 24 h. The photocatalytic activities of samples 1A-C, 4A-C were evaluated by the reduction of CO 2 in H 2 O 9,43 (see Section 3.3).The apparatus used for the photocatalytic experiments consists of a three necked Pyrex batch photoreactor of cylindrical shape containing 20 mL of aqueous suspension.The photoreactor was provided with a jacket for cooling water circulation and ports in its upper section for the inlet and outlet of gases, for sampling and for pH and temperature measurements.A HRC UV-VIS lamp 300 W (Sanolux, Milan, Italy) and Xe-Halogen lamp 400 W (Radium, Milan, Italy) were placed in proximity (5-6 cm) of the reactor.Argon was bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, and then CO 2 for approximately 60 min before switching on the lamps.The amounts of catalyst used were 150 and 500 mg in 20 mL of solution (loading of 7.5 and 25 mg/mL).The initial pH was 4.58.The temperature inside the reactor was held at approximately 25 C by a continuous circulation of water in the jacket around the photoreactor.The photoreactivity runs lasted in 5.0 h and the products were detected by Ion Cromatography and GC-BID. Experiments were performed following a protocol previously reported in literature 18,44,45.The proper amount of the TiO 2 /MWCNTs powder was dispersed in a mixture of chloroform (61) hexane (27) and ethanol (12), obtaining a concentration of 5000 ppm.Finally, the required volume of a stock solution of UBA in EtOH (2.5 10 -3 M) was added to reach the desired CHCl 3 :Hexane: EtOH ratio, and fix the final UBA concentration at 10 -5 M. Such a reaction mixture was poured in a quartz cuvette, sealed by a Teflon-faced rubber cap and purged under N 2 flow for 20 min, under stirring.Such a procedure has a twofold role: (i) to remove oxygen from the reaction environment and (ii) to promote the absorption-desorption equilibria between the photocatalyst and the UBA.Next, the mixture, was irradiated under continuous stirring with UV light using a medium pressure 200 W mercury lamp ( 250 nm), equipped with neutral density filters in order to achieve a light flux of 5 mW/cm 2 .At scheduled time intervals, the cuvette was removed from the light source and the reaction mixture was transferred in a centrifuge tube under inert atmosphere.The UBA/photocatalyst suspension was separated by centrifugation, and the liquid phase analyzed by absorption spectroscopy.The reaction was monitored by recording difference absorption spectra of the irradiated reaction mixtures.Any change in the absorption line-shape was then clearly identified for each sample, by considering as reference the respective unphotolyzed solution.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2/MWCNTs composites", "source": "In summary, we have found that polyethylenimine (PEI) anchored onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes can strongly enhance photocatalytic performances of TiO 2 /MWCNTs composites, rendering these materials efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion into formic and acetic acids.", "context": "In summary, we have found that polyethylenimine (PEI) anchored onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes can strongly enhance photocatalytic performances of TiO 2 /MWCNTs composites, rendering these materials efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion into formic and acetic acids.The simultaneous presence of PEI and CNTs is essential for catalysis, as demonstrated by the high sorbent capacity of TiO 2 PEI-MWCNTs (4C) (18 mL/g) that enables both CO 2 capture and activation, most probably via carbamate formation.Bleaching experiments corroborate in part the beneficial role of PEI in enhancing the photoreducing power of TiO 2 /MWCNTs composites in the UV range by means of a plausible auxochrome effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in the literature in which amines-grafted CNTs materials can function as TiO 2 co-catalysts for converting CO 2 into carboxylic acids.We hope this work opens new avenues for carbon recycling using renewable sources.

Photocatalytic conditions were chosen according to the goal of this study: the development of a metal free catalyst system that mimics the natural photosynthetic process, i.e., ambient temperature, sunlight radiation and water as the hydrogen source.As a further aim of this work, we attempted to investigate the influence of radiation source on photocatalysis using two different emitting lamps: (i) the SANOLUX lamp, displaying a higher radiance in the near UV (315-400 nm) and the Xe-Halogen lamp, possessing the major emission power in the visible range (400-700 nm, see FigureS6in Supplemetary Materials).Photoreduction was performed in a water phase suspension (20 mL) of the solid catalyst (with the loading in the range of 7.5-30 mg solid.cat./mL), and monitoring reaction parameters and species produced in both the liquid solution and in the gas phase of the reactor head space43 (see FigureS5).Argon was initially bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, then CO 2 for approximately 60 min, to saturate the reaction mixture, upon which suspension was irradiated for 5 h under vigorous stirring at room temperature.Initial pH value of solution after bubbling was found to be equal to 4.78, and raised to 5.80 after reaction.Under the chosen conditions, nanocomposites proved to be active in converting CO 2 into formic and acetic acids (Scheme 2), while neither simple PEI-grafted nanotubes nor bare TiO 2 displayed appreciable activity (Table5, runs 1-2).The optimal irradiaton time of 5 h was ascertained by monitoring photoreduction in the first 7 h of reaction (Figure6).Results showed that prolonged reaction times(5 h) led to the decrease of yield in formic acid with the corresponding increment of acetic acid.A plausible explanation could be related to the partial transformation of HCOOH into CH 3 COOH by reaction with methyl radicals (CH 3 ), according to the general mechanism proposed by S. Sharifnia et al.52. Figure 5. Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials Scheme 2: Photoreduction of carbon dioxide. Scheme 2. Photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in the literature in which amines-grafted CNTs materials can function as TiO 2 co-catalysts for converting CO 2 into carboxylic acids.We hope this work opens new avenues for carbon recycling using renewable sources.

Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials. Photocatalytic conditions were chosen according to the goal of this study: the development of a metal free catalyst system that mimics the natural photosynthetic process, i.e., ambient temperature, sunlight radiation and water as the hydrogen source.As a further aim of this work, we attempted to investigate the influence of radiation source on photocatalysis using two different emitting lamps: (i) the SANOLUX lamp, displaying a higher radiance in the near UV (315-400 nm) and the Xe-Halogen lamp, possessing the major emission power in the visible range (400-700 nm, see FigureS6in Supplemetary Materials).Photoreduction was performed in a water phase suspension (20 mL) of the solid catalyst (with the loading in the range of 7.5-30 mg solid.cat./mL), and monitoring reaction parameters and species produced in both the liquid solution and in the gas phase of the reactor head space43 (see FigureS5).Argon was initially bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, then CO 2 for approximately 60 min, to saturate the reaction mixture, upon which suspension was irradiated for 5 h under vigorous stirring at room temperature.Initial pH value of solution after bubbling was found to be equal to 4.78, and raised to 5.80 after reaction.Under the chosen conditions, nanocomposites proved to be active in converting CO 2 into formic and acetic acids (Scheme 2), while neither simple PEI-grafted nanotubes nor bare TiO 2 displayed appreciable activity (Table5, runs 1-2).The optimal irradiaton time of 5 h was ascertained by monitoring photoreduction in the first 7 h of reaction (Figure6).Results showed that prolonged reaction times(5 h) led to the decrease of yield in formic acid with the corresponding increment of acetic acid.A plausible explanation could be related to the partial transformation of HCOOH into CH 3 COOH by reaction with methyl radicals (CH 3 ), according to the general mechanism proposed by S. Sharifnia et al.52. Figure 5. Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials Scheme 2: Photoreduction of carbon dioxide. Scheme 2. Photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

Carbon dioxide, O 2 , Argon and Helium were with purity of 99.99, a gas burette (Figure S1) was used to measure gas volume in adsorption/desorption experiments.Formic and acetic acid analyses were performed with an Ion Chromatograph Dionex DX120 (Ion Pac ICE-AS6 Analytical Column, Monza, Italy); 0.8 mM heptafluorobutyric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as eluent (flow 1.00 mL/min) and 5.0 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as regenerating eluent (flow 4.5 mL/min). Formic acid 99 and acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich) were employed as standard for building IC calibration curves.Analyses were carried out by using a sample loop of 25 L, with a column pressure less than 640 PSI and a background of 35-40 S. GC analyses for liquid and gas phase were performed with a GC Tracera Shimadzu 2010 (Milan, Italy) with a Detector BID-2010 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) plus and a Micropacked ST column (temperature program isotherm at 40 C 30 min).Infrared analyses were performed in the range 400-4000 cm -1 (64 scans), using a PerkinElmer 2000 FT-IR spectrometer (Milan, Italy). Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, GA, USA) using a flowing nitrogen atmosphere.The samples (about 1 mg per sample) were equilibrated at 100 C for 20 min and then heated at a rate of 10 C min -1 up to 800 C. Elemental analyses were performed on a Thermo Flash EA 1112 series CHNS-O elemental analyzer (Monza, Italy) with an accepted tolerance of 0.4 units. TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analyses were performed with a TEM Philips EM208 instrument (Vienna, Austria) using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.The samples were prepared by dropping aliquots of the DMF dispersions onto TEM grids (200 mesh, Nichel, carbon only, Ted Pella, Milan, Italy). BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface area was obtained by N 2 adsorption-desorption method on powder samples using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics, Norcross, U.S.A.).The samples (500 mg) were pre-treated at 80 C for 2 h before N 2 adsorption.FE-SEM investigations were performed by a Zeiss Sigma (Milan, Italy) microscope operating in the range 0.5-20 kV and equipped with an in-lens secondary electron detector.FE-SEM samples were prepared by sticking the powder on double sided carbon tape.Samples were mounted onto stainless-steel sample holders by using and grounded by silver paste. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR Cary 5 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (BaSO 4 ). X-Ray powder diffraction data were collected at room temperature by using an automated Rigaku RINT2500 laboratory diffractometer (50 KV, 200 mA, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) equipped with the silicon strip Rigaku D/teX Ultra detector.Detailed XRD analyses of hybrids nanocomposites are showed in Figure S2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer (Phisical Electronics, Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at a spot size of 100 m, corresponding to a power of 24.4 W. Survey (0-1400 eV) and high resolution (C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p, Cl 2p, F 1s) spectra were recorded in FAT (fixed analyzer transmission) mode at pass energy of 117.4 eV and 46.95 eV, respectively.All spectra were acquired at a take-off angle of 45 with respect to the sample normal.Dual-beam charge neutralization was constantly applied during analysis.Charge correction of the spectra was performed by taking the sp2 graphitic component of the C 1s spectrum as internal reference (binding energy, BE 284.6 eV). XPS analysis was repeated on three different spots for each sample.During analyses, special care was devoted to verifying that no change in the samples was induced by exposure to the X-ray beam and the charge neutralization dual-beam.Detailed spectra processing was performed by commercial MultiPak software (Version 9.5.0.8, 30-10-2013, Ulvac-PHI, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan).The high-resolution spectra were fitted with mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian peaks after a Shirley background subtraction. The DO 9721 quantum photo-radiometer (Delta Ohm, Pordenone, Italy) and thermometer data logger were used for measuring illuminance, irradiance, luminance and temperature. Preparation was accomplished according to our previous method 41,42.MWCNTs (600-1000 mg) were placed in CH 2 Cl 2 (50-100 mL) and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min.An aliquot (35 mmol) of the standardized cold solution of methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO, 70 mL, 0.5 M) in 1,1,1-trifluoropropanone (TFP), was then added in one portion to the mixture, which was stirred and kept at 0 C.After 24 h the reaction was complete, the mixture was filtered, and ox-CNTs 2 were washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH, with recovery of 700-1300 mg. This procedure was used for preparation of amine grafted-MWCNTs 3 and 4 41,42.Oxidized nanotubes 2 (1 g) were dispersed in 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (3.7 g) or branched polyethylenimine (5 g PEI MW 600, 99 of purity) and the mixture was heated at reflux at 140 C under N 2 for 12 h.Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (20 mL) and filtered through a PTFE membrane filter paper (0.2 m).The solid was washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH to remove any excess of amine leading to HMDA-MWCNTs (3, 1.20 g) or PEI -MWCNTs (4, 1.25 g).Elemental analyses for 3: C (95.45), H (3.24), O (0.30), N (1.01); for 4: C (91.59), H (5.61), O (0.17), N (2.63). Preparation of hybrids nanocomposites was accomplished to previous method 14, titanium tetrachloride (98 TiCl 4 ), hydrochloric acid (38 HCl) and distilled water with a molar ratio of TiCl 4 :HCl:H 2 O 0.1:1:200 were homogenized under magnetic stirring for 30 min.The thus obtained transparent mother solution was then used as the raw material for preparing nanocomposites for photocatalytic experiments.Proper amounts of both p-MWCNTs (1) and functionalized PEI-MWCNTs (4) were separately dispersed into the proper volume of mother solution according to Table 1.After suspension, mixture was sonicated and then ammonia was slowly added (until neutrality) under vigorous stirring, thus inducing TiO 2 precipitation and formation of random agglomerates by inclusion of CNTs 14.After filtration, nanocomposites 1A, 1C and 4A-C were washed with distilled water and dried at 80 C for 24 h. The photocatalytic activities of samples 1A-C, 4A-C were evaluated by the reduction of CO 2 in H 2 O 9,43 (see Section 3.3).The apparatus used for the photocatalytic experiments consists of a three necked Pyrex batch photoreactor of cylindrical shape containing 20 mL of aqueous suspension.The photoreactor was provided with a jacket for cooling water circulation and ports in its upper section for the inlet and outlet of gases, for sampling and for pH and temperature measurements.A HRC UV-VIS lamp 300 W (Sanolux, Milan, Italy) and Xe-Halogen lamp 400 W (Radium, Milan, Italy) were placed in proximity (5-6 cm) of the reactor.Argon was bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, and then CO 2 for approximately 60 min before switching on the lamps.The amounts of catalyst used were 150 and 500 mg in 20 mL of solution (loading of 7.5 and 25 mg/mL).The initial pH was 4.58.The temperature inside the reactor was held at approximately 25 C by a continuous circulation of water in the jacket around the photoreactor.The photoreactivity runs lasted in 5.0 h and the products were detected by Ion Cromatography and GC-BID. Experiments were performed following a protocol previously reported in literature 18,44,45.The proper amount of the TiO 2 /MWCNTs powder was dispersed in a mixture of chloroform (61) hexane (27) and ethanol (12), obtaining a concentration of 5000 ppm.Finally, the required volume of a stock solution of UBA in EtOH (2.5 10 -3 M) was added to reach the desired CHCl 3 :Hexane: EtOH ratio, and fix the final UBA concentration at 10 -5 M. Such a reaction mixture was poured in a quartz cuvette, sealed by a Teflon-faced rubber cap and purged under N 2 flow for 20 min, under stirring.Such a procedure has a twofold role: (i) to remove oxygen from the reaction environment and (ii) to promote the absorption-desorption equilibria between the photocatalyst and the UBA.Next, the mixture, was irradiated under continuous stirring with UV light using a medium pressure 200 W mercury lamp ( 250 nm), equipped with neutral density filters in order to achieve a light flux of 5 mW/cm 2 .At scheduled time intervals, the cuvette was removed from the light source and the reaction mixture was transferred in a centrifuge tube under inert atmosphere.The UBA/photocatalyst suspension was separated by centrifugation, and the liquid phase analyzed by absorption spectroscopy.The reaction was monitored by recording difference absorption spectra of the irradiated reaction mixtures.Any change in the absorption line-shape was then clearly identified for each sample, by considering as reference the respective unphotolyzed solution.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Xe-Halogen lamp", "source": "A HRC UV-VIS lamp 300 W (Sanolux, Milan, Italy) and Xe-Halogen lamp 400 W (Radium, Milan, Italy) were placed in proximity (5-6 cm) of the reactor.", "context": "Common commercial solvents and reagents of high purity were employed.Commercial Caroat (Pullach, Germany) triple salt (2KHSO 5 KHSO 4 K 2 SO 4 ), a gift from Peroxid-Chemie (Degussa, Germany), was the source of potassium monoperoxysulfate (caroate) for the synthesis of TFDO 39,40.MWCNTs (purity 90 wt., diameter between 0.7 and 1.4 nm) are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy) in form of powder.

Such a reaction mixture was poured in a quartz cuvette, sealed by a Teflon-faced rubber cap and purged under N 2 flow for 20 min, under stirring.Such a procedure has a twofold role: (i) to remove oxygen from the reaction environment and (ii) to promote the absorption-desorption equilibria between the photocatalyst and the UBA.Next, the mixture, was irradiated under continuous stirring with UV light using a medium pressure 200 W mercury lamp ( 250 nm), equipped with neutral density filters in order to achieve a light flux of 5 mW/cm 2 .At scheduled time intervals, the cuvette was removed from the light source and the reaction mixture was transferred in a centrifuge tube under inert atmosphere.The UBA/photocatalyst suspension was separated by centrifugation, and the liquid phase analyzed by absorption spectroscopy.The reaction was monitored by recording difference absorption spectra of the irradiated reaction mixtures.Any change in the absorption line-shape was then clearly identified for each sample, by considering as reference the respective unphotolyzed solution.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "mercury lamp", "source": "Next, the mixture, was irradiated under continuous stirring with UV light using a medium pressure 200 W mercury lamp ( 250 nm), equipped with neutral density filters in order to achieve a light flux of 5 mW/cm 2 .", "context": "Common commercial solvents and reagents of high purity were employed.Commercial Caroat (Pullach, Germany) triple salt (2KHSO 5 KHSO 4 K 2 SO 4 ), a gift from Peroxid-Chemie (Degussa, Germany), was the source of potassium monoperoxysulfate (caroate) for the synthesis of TFDO 39,40.MWCNTs (purity 90 wt., diameter between 0.7 and 1.4 nm) are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy) in form of powder. Carbon dioxide, O 2 , Argon and Helium were with purity of 99.99, a gas burette (Figure S1) was used to measure gas volume in adsorption/desorption experiments.Formic and acetic acid analyses were performed with an Ion Chromatograph Dionex DX120 (Ion Pac ICE-AS6 Analytical Column, Monza, Italy); 0.8 mM heptafluorobutyric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as eluent (flow 1.00 mL/min) and 5.0 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as regenerating eluent (flow 4.5 mL/min). Formic acid 99 and acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich) were employed as standard for building IC calibration curves.Analyses were carried out by using a sample loop of 25 L, with a column pressure less than 640 PSI and a background of 35-40 S. GC analyses for liquid and gas phase were performed with a GC Tracera Shimadzu 2010 (Milan, Italy) with a Detector BID-2010 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) plus and a Micropacked ST column (temperature program isotherm at 40 C 30 min).Infrared analyses were performed in the range 400-4000 cm -1 (64 scans), using a PerkinElmer 2000 FT-IR spectrometer (Milan, Italy). Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, GA, USA) using a flowing nitrogen atmosphere.The samples (about 1 mg per sample) were equilibrated at 100 C for 20 min and then heated at a rate of 10 C min -1 up to 800 C. Elemental analyses were performed on a Thermo Flash EA 1112 series CHNS-O elemental analyzer (Monza, Italy) with an accepted tolerance of 0.4 units. TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analyses were performed with a TEM Philips EM208 instrument (Vienna, Austria) using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.The samples were prepared by dropping aliquots of the DMF dispersions onto TEM grids (200 mesh, Nichel, carbon only, Ted Pella, Milan, Italy). BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface area was obtained by N 2 adsorption-desorption method on powder samples using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics, Norcross, U.S.A.).The samples (500 mg) were pre-treated at 80 C for 2 h before N 2 adsorption.FE-SEM investigations were performed by a Zeiss Sigma (Milan, Italy) microscope operating in the range 0.5-20 kV and equipped with an in-lens secondary electron detector.FE-SEM samples were prepared by sticking the powder on double sided carbon tape.Samples were mounted onto stainless-steel sample holders by using and grounded by silver paste. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR Cary 5 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (BaSO 4 ). X-Ray powder diffraction data were collected at room temperature by using an automated Rigaku RINT2500 laboratory diffractometer (50 KV, 200 mA, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) equipped with the silicon strip Rigaku D/teX Ultra detector.Detailed XRD analyses of hybrids nanocomposites are showed in Figure S2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer (Phisical Electronics, Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at a spot size of 100 m, corresponding to a power of 24.4 W. Survey (0-1400 eV) and high resolution (C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p, Cl 2p, F 1s) spectra were recorded in FAT (fixed analyzer transmission) mode at pass energy of 117.4 eV and 46.95 eV, respectively.All spectra were acquired at a take-off angle of 45 with respect to the sample normal.Dual-beam charge neutralization was constantly applied during analysis.Charge correction of the spectra was performed by taking the sp2 graphitic component of the C 1s spectrum as internal reference (binding energy, BE 284.6 eV). XPS analysis was repeated on three different spots for each sample.During analyses, special care was devoted to verifying that no change in the samples was induced by exposure to the X-ray beam and the charge neutralization dual-beam.Detailed spectra processing was performed by commercial MultiPak software (Version 9.5.0.8, 30-10-2013, Ulvac-PHI, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan).The high-resolution spectra were fitted with mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian peaks after a Shirley background subtraction. The DO 9721 quantum photo-radiometer (Delta Ohm, Pordenone, Italy) and thermometer data logger were used for measuring illuminance, irradiance, luminance and temperature. Preparation was accomplished according to our previous method 41,42.MWCNTs (600-1000 mg) were placed in CH 2 Cl 2 (50-100 mL) and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min.An aliquot (35 mmol) of the standardized cold solution of methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO, 70 mL, 0.5 M) in 1,1,1-trifluoropropanone (TFP), was then added in one portion to the mixture, which was stirred and kept at 0 C.After 24 h the reaction was complete, the mixture was filtered, and ox-CNTs 2 were washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH, with recovery of 700-1300 mg. This procedure was used for preparation of amine grafted-MWCNTs 3 and 4 41,42.Oxidized nanotubes 2 (1 g) were dispersed in 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (3.7 g) or branched polyethylenimine (5 g PEI MW 600, 99 of purity) and the mixture was heated at reflux at 140 C under N 2 for 12 h.Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (20 mL) and filtered through a PTFE membrane filter paper (0.2 m).The solid was washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH to remove any excess of amine leading to HMDA-MWCNTs (3, 1.20 g) or PEI -MWCNTs (4, 1.25 g).Elemental analyses for 3: C (95.45), H (3.24), O (0.30), N (1.01); for 4: C (91.59), H (5.61), O (0.17), N (2.63). Preparation of hybrids nanocomposites was accomplished to previous method 14, titanium tetrachloride (98 TiCl 4 ), hydrochloric acid (38 HCl) and distilled water with a molar ratio of TiCl 4 :HCl:H 2 O 0.1:1:200 were homogenized under magnetic stirring for 30 min.The thus obtained transparent mother solution was then used as the raw material for preparing nanocomposites for photocatalytic experiments.Proper amounts of both p-MWCNTs (1) and functionalized PEI-MWCNTs (4) were separately dispersed into the proper volume of mother solution according to Table 1.After suspension, mixture was sonicated and then ammonia was slowly added (until neutrality) under vigorous stirring, thus inducing TiO 2 precipitation and formation of random agglomerates by inclusion of CNTs 14.After filtration, nanocomposites 1A, 1C and 4A-C were washed with distilled water and dried at 80 C for 24 h.

Photocatalytic conditions were chosen according to the goal of this study: the development of a metal free catalyst system that mimics the natural photosynthetic process, i.e., ambient temperature, sunlight radiation and water as the hydrogen source.As a further aim of this work, we attempted to investigate the influence of radiation source on photocatalysis using two different emitting lamps: (i) the SANOLUX lamp, displaying a higher radiance in the near UV (315-400 nm) and the Xe-Halogen lamp, possessing the major emission power in the visible range (400-700 nm, see FigureS6in Supplemetary Materials).Photoreduction was performed in a water phase suspension (20 mL) of the solid catalyst (with the loading in the range of 7.5-30 mg solid.cat./mL), and monitoring reaction parameters and species produced in both the liquid solution and in the gas phase of the reactor head space43 (see FigureS5).Argon was initially bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, then CO 2 for approximately 60 min, to saturate the reaction mixture, upon which suspension was irradiated for 5 h under vigorous stirring at room temperature.Initial pH value of solution after bubbling was found to be equal to 4.78, and raised to 5.80 after reaction.Under the chosen conditions, nanocomposites proved to be active in converting CO 2 into formic and acetic acids (Scheme 2), while neither simple PEI-grafted nanotubes nor bare TiO 2 displayed appreciable activity (Table5, runs 1-2).The optimal irradiaton time of 5 h was ascertained by monitoring photoreduction in the first 7 h of reaction (Figure6).Results showed that prolonged reaction times(5 h) led to the decrease of yield in formic acid with the corresponding increment of acetic acid.A plausible explanation could be related to the partial transformation of HCOOH into CH 3 COOH by reaction with methyl radicals (CH 3 ), according to the general mechanism proposed by S.

Carbon dioxide, O 2 , Argon and Helium were with purity of 99.99, a gas burette (Figure S1) was used to measure gas volume in adsorption/desorption experiments.Formic and acetic acid analyses were performed with an Ion Chromatograph Dionex DX120 (Ion Pac ICE-AS6 Analytical Column, Monza, Italy); 0.8 mM heptafluorobutyric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as eluent (flow 1.00 mL/min) and 5.0 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as regenerating eluent (flow 4.5 mL/min). Formic acid 99 and acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich) were employed as standard for building IC calibration curves.Analyses were carried out by using a sample loop of 25 L, with a column pressure less than 640 PSI and a background of 35-40 S. GC analyses for liquid and gas phase were performed with a GC Tracera Shimadzu 2010 (Milan, Italy) with a Detector BID-2010 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) plus and a Micropacked ST column (temperature program isotherm at 40 C 30 min).Infrared analyses were performed in the range 400-4000 cm -1 (64 scans), using a PerkinElmer 2000 FT-IR spectrometer (Milan, Italy). Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, GA, USA) using a flowing nitrogen atmosphere.The samples (about 1 mg per sample) were equilibrated at 100 C for 20 min and then heated at a rate of 10 C min -1 up to 800 C. Elemental analyses were performed on a Thermo Flash EA 1112 series CHNS-O elemental analyzer (Monza, Italy) with an accepted tolerance of 0.4 units. TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analyses were performed with a TEM Philips EM208 instrument (Vienna, Austria) using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.The samples were prepared by dropping aliquots of the DMF dispersions onto TEM grids (200 mesh, Nichel, carbon only, Ted Pella, Milan, Italy). BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface area was obtained by N 2 adsorption-desorption method on powder samples using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics, Norcross, U.S.A.).The samples (500 mg) were pre-treated at 80 C for 2 h before N 2 adsorption.FE-SEM investigations were performed by a Zeiss Sigma (Milan, Italy) microscope operating in the range 0.5-20 kV and equipped with an in-lens secondary electron detector.FE-SEM samples were prepared by sticking the powder on double sided carbon tape.Samples were mounted onto stainless-steel sample holders by using and grounded by silver paste. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR Cary 5 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (BaSO 4 ). X-Ray powder diffraction data were collected at room temperature by using an automated Rigaku RINT2500 laboratory diffractometer (50 KV, 200 mA, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) equipped with the silicon strip Rigaku D/teX Ultra detector.Detailed XRD analyses of hybrids nanocomposites are showed in Figure S2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer (Phisical Electronics, Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at a spot size of 100 m, corresponding to a power of 24.4 W. Survey (0-1400 eV) and high resolution (C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p, Cl 2p, F 1s) spectra were recorded in FAT (fixed analyzer transmission) mode at pass energy of 117.4 eV and 46.95 eV, respectively.All spectra were acquired at a take-off angle of 45 with respect to the sample normal.Dual-beam charge neutralization was constantly applied during analysis.Charge correction of the spectra was performed by taking the sp2 graphitic component of the C 1s spectrum as internal reference (binding energy, BE 284.6 eV). XPS analysis was repeated on three different spots for each sample.During analyses, special care was devoted to verifying that no change in the samples was induced by exposure to the X-ray beam and the charge neutralization dual-beam.Detailed spectra processing was performed by commercial MultiPak software (Version 9.5.0.8, 30-10-2013, Ulvac-PHI, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan).The high-resolution spectra were fitted with mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian peaks after a Shirley background subtraction. The DO 9721 quantum photo-radiometer (Delta Ohm, Pordenone, Italy) and thermometer data logger were used for measuring illuminance, irradiance, luminance and temperature. Preparation was accomplished according to our previous method 41,42.MWCNTs (600-1000 mg) were placed in CH 2 Cl 2 (50-100 mL) and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min.An aliquot (35 mmol) of the standardized cold solution of methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO, 70 mL, 0.5 M) in 1,1,1-trifluoropropanone (TFP), was then added in one portion to the mixture, which was stirred and kept at 0 C.After 24 h the reaction was complete, the mixture was filtered, and ox-CNTs 2 were washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH, with recovery of 700-1300 mg. This procedure was used for preparation of amine grafted-MWCNTs 3 and 4 41,42.Oxidized nanotubes 2 (1 g) were dispersed in 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (3.7 g) or branched polyethylenimine (5 g PEI MW 600, 99 of purity) and the mixture was heated at reflux at 140 C under N 2 for 12 h.Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (20 mL) and filtered through a PTFE membrane filter paper (0.2 m).The solid was washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH to remove any excess of amine leading to HMDA-MWCNTs (3, 1.20 g) or PEI -MWCNTs (4, 1.25 g).Elemental analyses for 3: C (95.45), H (3.24), O (0.30), N (1.01); for 4: C (91.59), H (5.61), O (0.17), N (2.63). Preparation of hybrids nanocomposites was accomplished to previous method 14, titanium tetrachloride (98 TiCl 4 ), hydrochloric acid (38 HCl) and distilled water with a molar ratio of TiCl 4 :HCl:H 2 O 0.1:1:200 were homogenized under magnetic stirring for 30 min.The thus obtained transparent mother solution was then used as the raw material for preparing nanocomposites for photocatalytic experiments.Proper amounts of both p-MWCNTs (1) and functionalized PEI-MWCNTs (4) were separately dispersed into the proper volume of mother solution according to Table 1.After suspension, mixture was sonicated and then ammonia was slowly added (until neutrality) under vigorous stirring, thus inducing TiO 2 precipitation and formation of random agglomerates by inclusion of CNTs 14.After filtration, nanocomposites 1A, 1C and 4A-C were washed with distilled water and dried at 80 C for 24 h. The photocatalytic activities of samples 1A-C, 4A-C were evaluated by the reduction of CO 2 in H 2 O 9,43 (see Section 3.3).The apparatus used for the photocatalytic experiments consists of a three necked Pyrex batch photoreactor of cylindrical shape containing 20 mL of aqueous suspension.The photoreactor was provided with a jacket for cooling water circulation and ports in its upper section for the inlet and outlet of gases, for sampling and for pH and temperature measurements.A HRC UV-VIS lamp 300 W (Sanolux, Milan, Italy) and Xe-Halogen lamp 400 W (Radium, Milan, Italy) were placed in proximity (5-6 cm) of the reactor.Argon was bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, and then CO 2 for approximately 60 min before switching on the lamps.The amounts of catalyst used were 150 and 500 mg in 20 mL of solution (loading of 7.5 and 25 mg/mL).The initial pH was 4.58.The temperature inside the reactor was held at approximately 25 C by a continuous circulation of water in the jacket around the photoreactor.The photoreactivity runs lasted in 5.0 h and the products were detected by Ion Cromatography and GC-BID. Experiments were performed following a protocol previously reported in literature 18,44,45.The proper amount of the TiO 2 /MWCNTs powder was dispersed in a mixture of chloroform (61) hexane (27) and ethanol (12), obtaining a concentration of 5000 ppm.Finally, the required volume of a stock solution of UBA in EtOH (2.5 10 -3 M) was added to reach the desired CHCl 3 :Hexane: EtOH ratio, and fix the final UBA concentration at 10 -5 M. Such a reaction mixture was poured in a quartz cuvette, sealed by a Teflon-faced rubber cap and purged under N 2 flow for 20 min, under stirring.Such a procedure has a twofold role: (i) to remove oxygen from the reaction environment and (ii) to promote the absorption-desorption equilibria between the photocatalyst and the UBA.Next, the mixture, was irradiated under continuous stirring with UV light using a medium pressure 200 W mercury lamp ( 250 nm), equipped with neutral density filters in order to achieve a light flux of 5 mW/cm 2 .At scheduled time intervals, the cuvette was removed from the light source and the reaction mixture was transferred in a centrifuge tube under inert atmosphere.The UBA/photocatalyst suspension was separated by centrifugation, and the liquid phase analyzed by absorption spectroscopy.The reaction was monitored by recording difference absorption spectra of the irradiated reaction mixtures.Any change in the absorption line-shape was then clearly identified for each sample, by considering as reference the respective unphotolyzed solution.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "GC analyses for liquid and gas phase were performed with a GC Tracera Shimadzu 2010 (Milan, Italy) with a Detector BID-2010 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) plus and a Micropacked ST column (temperature program isotherm at 40 C 30 min).", "context": "Common commercial solvents and reagents of high purity were employed.Commercial Caroat (Pullach, Germany) triple salt (2KHSO 5 KHSO 4 K 2 SO 4 ), a gift from Peroxid-Chemie (Degussa, Germany), was the source of potassium monoperoxysulfate (caroate) for the synthesis of TFDO 39,40.MWCNTs (purity 90 wt., diameter between 0.7 and 1.4 nm) are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy) in form of powder.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in the literature in which amines-grafted CNTs materials can function as TiO 2 co-catalysts for converting CO 2 into carboxylic acids.We hope this work opens new avenues for carbon recycling using renewable sources.

Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials. Photocatalytic conditions were chosen according to the goal of this study: the development of a metal free catalyst system that mimics the natural photosynthetic process, i.e., ambient temperature, sunlight radiation and water as the hydrogen source.As a further aim of this work, we attempted to investigate the influence of radiation source on photocatalysis using two different emitting lamps: (i) the SANOLUX lamp, displaying a higher radiance in the near UV (315-400 nm) and the Xe-Halogen lamp, possessing the major emission power in the visible range (400-700 nm, see FigureS6in Supplemetary Materials).Photoreduction was performed in a water phase suspension (20 mL) of the solid catalyst (with the loading in the range of 7.5-30 mg solid.cat./mL), and monitoring reaction parameters and species produced in both the liquid solution and in the gas phase of the reactor head space43 (see FigureS5).Argon was initially bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, then CO 2 for approximately 60 min, to saturate the reaction mixture, upon which suspension was irradiated for 5 h under vigorous stirring at room temperature.Initial pH value of solution after bubbling was found to be equal to 4.78, and raised to 5.80 after reaction.Under the chosen conditions, nanocomposites proved to be active in converting CO 2 into formic and acetic acids (Scheme 2), while neither simple PEI-grafted nanotubes nor bare TiO 2 displayed appreciable activity (Table5, runs 1-2).The optimal irradiaton time of 5 h was ascertained by monitoring photoreduction in the first 7 h of reaction (Figure6).Results showed that prolonged reaction times(5 h) led to the decrease of yield in formic acid with the corresponding increment of acetic acid.A plausible explanation could be related to the partial transformation of HCOOH into CH 3 COOH by reaction with methyl radicals (CH 3 ), according to the general mechanism proposed by S. Sharifnia et al.52. Figure 5. Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials Scheme 2: Photoreduction of carbon dioxide. Scheme 2. Photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

Carbon dioxide, O 2 , Argon and Helium were with purity of 99.99, a gas burette (Figure S1) was used to measure gas volume in adsorption/desorption experiments.Formic and acetic acid analyses were performed with an Ion Chromatograph Dionex DX120 (Ion Pac ICE-AS6 Analytical Column, Monza, Italy); 0.8 mM heptafluorobutyric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as eluent (flow 1.00 mL/min) and 5.0 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as regenerating eluent (flow 4.5 mL/min). Formic acid 99 and acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich) were employed as standard for building IC calibration curves.Analyses were carried out by using a sample loop of 25 L, with a column pressure less than 640 PSI and a background of 35-40 S. GC analyses for liquid and gas phase were performed with a GC Tracera Shimadzu 2010 (Milan, Italy) with a Detector BID-2010 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) plus and a Micropacked ST column (temperature program isotherm at 40 C 30 min).Infrared analyses were performed in the range 400-4000 cm -1 (64 scans), using a PerkinElmer 2000 FT-IR spectrometer (Milan, Italy). Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, GA, USA) using a flowing nitrogen atmosphere.The samples (about 1 mg per sample) were equilibrated at 100 C for 20 min and then heated at a rate of 10 C min -1 up to 800 C. Elemental analyses were performed on a Thermo Flash EA 1112 series CHNS-O elemental analyzer (Monza, Italy) with an accepted tolerance of 0.4 units. TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analyses were performed with a TEM Philips EM208 instrument (Vienna, Austria) using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.The samples were prepared by dropping aliquots of the DMF dispersions onto TEM grids (200 mesh, Nichel, carbon only, Ted Pella, Milan, Italy). BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface area was obtained by N 2 adsorption-desorption method on powder samples using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics, Norcross, U.S.A.).The samples (500 mg) were pre-treated at 80 C for 2 h before N 2 adsorption.FE-SEM investigations were performed by a Zeiss Sigma (Milan, Italy) microscope operating in the range 0.5-20 kV and equipped with an in-lens secondary electron detector.FE-SEM samples were prepared by sticking the powder on double sided carbon tape.Samples were mounted onto stainless-steel sample holders by using and grounded by silver paste. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR Cary 5 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (BaSO 4 ). X-Ray powder diffraction data were collected at room temperature by using an automated Rigaku RINT2500 laboratory diffractometer (50 KV, 200 mA, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) equipped with the silicon strip Rigaku D/teX Ultra detector.Detailed XRD analyses of hybrids nanocomposites are showed in Figure S2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer (Phisical Electronics, Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at a spot size of 100 m, corresponding to a power of 24.4 W. Survey (0-1400 eV) and high resolution (C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p, Cl 2p, F 1s) spectra were recorded in FAT (fixed analyzer transmission) mode at pass energy of 117.4 eV and 46.95 eV, respectively.All spectra were acquired at a take-off angle of 45 with respect to the sample normal.Dual-beam charge neutralization was constantly applied during analysis.Charge correction of the spectra was performed by taking the sp2 graphitic component of the C 1s spectrum as internal reference (binding energy, BE 284.6 eV). XPS analysis was repeated on three different spots for each sample.During analyses, special care was devoted to verifying that no change in the samples was induced by exposure to the X-ray beam and the charge neutralization dual-beam.Detailed spectra processing was performed by commercial MultiPak software (Version 9.5.0.8, 30-10-2013, Ulvac-PHI, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan).The high-resolution spectra were fitted with mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian peaks after a Shirley background subtraction. The DO 9721 quantum photo-radiometer (Delta Ohm, Pordenone, Italy) and thermometer data logger were used for measuring illuminance, irradiance, luminance and temperature. Preparation was accomplished according to our previous method 41,42.MWCNTs (600-1000 mg) were placed in CH 2 Cl 2 (50-100 mL) and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min.An aliquot (35 mmol) of the standardized cold solution of methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO, 70 mL, 0.5 M) in 1,1,1-trifluoropropanone (TFP), was then added in one portion to the mixture, which was stirred and kept at 0 C.After 24 h the reaction was complete, the mixture was filtered, and ox-CNTs 2 were washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH, with recovery of 700-1300 mg. This procedure was used for preparation of amine grafted-MWCNTs 3 and 4 41,42.Oxidized nanotubes 2 (1 g) were dispersed in 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (3.7 g) or branched polyethylenimine (5 g PEI MW 600, 99 of purity) and the mixture was heated at reflux at 140 C under N 2 for 12 h.Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (20 mL) and filtered through a PTFE membrane filter paper (0.2 m).The solid was washed several times with CH 2 Cl 2 followed by MeOH to remove any excess of amine leading to HMDA-MWCNTs (3, 1.20 g) or PEI -MWCNTs (4, 1.25 g).Elemental analyses for 3: C (95.45), H (3.24), O (0.30), N (1.01); for 4: C (91.59), H (5.61), O (0.17), N (2.63). Preparation of hybrids nanocomposites was accomplished to previous method 14, titanium tetrachloride (98 TiCl 4 ), hydrochloric acid (38 HCl) and distilled water with a molar ratio of TiCl 4 :HCl:H 2 O 0.1:1:200 were homogenized under magnetic stirring for 30 min.The thus obtained transparent mother solution was then used as the raw material for preparing nanocomposites for photocatalytic experiments.Proper amounts of both p-MWCNTs (1) and functionalized PEI-MWCNTs (4) were separately dispersed into the proper volume of mother solution according to Table 1.After suspension, mixture was sonicated and then ammonia was slowly added (until neutrality) under vigorous stirring, thus inducing TiO 2 precipitation and formation of random agglomerates by inclusion of CNTs 14.After filtration, nanocomposites 1A, 1C and 4A-C were washed with distilled water and dried at 80 C for 24 h. The photocatalytic activities of samples 1A-C, 4A-C were evaluated by the reduction of CO 2 in H 2 O 9,43 (see Section 3.3).The apparatus used for the photocatalytic experiments consists of a three necked Pyrex batch photoreactor of cylindrical shape containing 20 mL of aqueous suspension.The photoreactor was provided with a jacket for cooling water circulation and ports in its upper section for the inlet and outlet of gases, for sampling and for pH and temperature measurements.A HRC UV-VIS lamp 300 W (Sanolux, Milan, Italy) and Xe-Halogen lamp 400 W (Radium, Milan, Italy) were placed in proximity (5-6 cm) of the reactor.Argon was bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, and then CO 2 for approximately 60 min before switching on the lamps.The amounts of catalyst used were 150 and 500 mg in 20 mL of solution (loading of 7.5 and 25 mg/mL).The initial pH was 4.58.The temperature inside the reactor was held at approximately 25 C by a continuous circulation of water in the jacket around the photoreactor.The photoreactivity runs lasted in 5.0 h and the products were detected by Ion Cromatography and GC-BID. Experiments were performed following a protocol previously reported in literature 18,44,45.The proper amount of the TiO 2 /MWCNTs powder was dispersed in a mixture of chloroform (61) hexane (27) and ethanol (12), obtaining a concentration of 5000 ppm.Finally, the required volume of a stock solution of UBA in EtOH (2.5 10 -3 M) was added to reach the desired CHCl 3 :Hexane: EtOH ratio, and fix the final UBA concentration at 10 -5 M. Such a reaction mixture was poured in a quartz cuvette, sealed by a Teflon-faced rubber cap and purged under N 2 flow for 20 min, under stirring.Such a procedure has a twofold role: (i) to remove oxygen from the reaction environment and (ii) to promote the absorption-desorption equilibria between the photocatalyst and the UBA.Next, the mixture, was irradiated under continuous stirring with UV light using a medium pressure 200 W mercury lamp ( 250 nm), equipped with neutral density filters in order to achieve a light flux of 5 mW/cm 2 .At scheduled time intervals, the cuvette was removed from the light source and the reaction mixture was transferred in a centrifuge tube under inert atmosphere.The UBA/photocatalyst suspension was separated by centrifugation, and the liquid phase analyzed by absorption spectroscopy.The reaction was monitored by recording difference absorption spectra of the irradiated reaction mixtures.Any change in the absorption line-shape was then clearly identified for each sample, by considering as reference the respective unphotolyzed solution.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "Photoreduction was performed in a water phase suspension (20 mL) of the solid catalyst (with the loading in the range of 7.5-30 mg solid.cat./mL), and monitoring reaction parameters and species produced in both the liquid solution and in the gas phase of the reactor head space43 (see FigureS5).", "context": "In summary, we have found that polyethylenimine (PEI) anchored onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes can strongly enhance photocatalytic performances of TiO 2 /MWCNTs composites, rendering these materials efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion into formic and acetic acids.The simultaneous presence of PEI and CNTs is essential for catalysis, as demonstrated by the high sorbent capacity of TiO 2 PEI-MWCNTs (4C) (18 mL/g) that enables both CO 2 capture and activation, most probably via carbamate formation.Bleaching experiments corroborate in part the beneficial role of PEI in enhancing the photoreducing power of TiO 2 /MWCNTs composites in the UV range by means of a plausible auxochrome effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in the literature in which amines-grafted CNTs materials can function as TiO 2 co-catalysts for converting CO 2 into carboxylic acids.We hope this work opens new avenues for carbon recycling using renewable sources.

Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials. Photocatalytic conditions were chosen according to the goal of this study: the development of a metal free catalyst system that mimics the natural photosynthetic process, i.e., ambient temperature, sunlight radiation and water as the hydrogen source.As a further aim of this work, we attempted to investigate the influence of radiation source on photocatalysis using two different emitting lamps: (i) the SANOLUX lamp, displaying a higher radiance in the near UV (315-400 nm) and the Xe-Halogen lamp, possessing the major emission power in the visible range (400-700 nm, see FigureS6in Supplemetary Materials).Photoreduction was performed in a water phase suspension (20 mL) of the solid catalyst (with the loading in the range of 7.5-30 mg solid.cat./mL), and monitoring reaction parameters and species produced in both the liquid solution and in the gas phase of the reactor head space43 (see FigureS5).Argon was initially bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, then CO 2 for approximately 60 min, to saturate the reaction mixture, upon which suspension was irradiated for 5 h under vigorous stirring at room temperature.Initial pH value of solution after bubbling was found to be equal to 4.78, and raised to 5.80 after reaction.Under the chosen conditions, nanocomposites proved to be active in converting CO 2 into formic and acetic acids (Scheme 2), while neither simple PEI-grafted nanotubes nor bare TiO 2 displayed appreciable activity (Table5, runs 1-2).The optimal irradiaton time of 5 h was ascertained by monitoring photoreduction in the first 7 h of reaction (Figure6).Results showed that prolonged reaction times(5 h) led to the decrease of yield in formic acid with the corresponding increment of acetic acid.A plausible explanation could be related to the partial transformation of HCOOH into CH 3 COOH by reaction with methyl radicals (CH 3 ), according to the general mechanism proposed by S. Sharifnia et al.52. Figure 5. Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials Scheme 2: Photoreduction of carbon dioxide. Scheme 2. Photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials. Photocatalytic conditions were chosen according to the goal of this study: the development of a metal free catalyst system that mimics the natural photosynthetic process, i.e., ambient temperature, sunlight radiation and water as the hydrogen source.As a further aim of this work, we attempted to investigate the influence of radiation source on photocatalysis using two different emitting lamps: (i) the SANOLUX lamp, displaying a higher radiance in the near UV (315-400 nm) and the Xe-Halogen lamp, possessing the major emission power in the visible range (400-700 nm, see FigureS6in Supplemetary Materials).Photoreduction was performed in a water phase suspension (20 mL) of the solid catalyst (with the loading in the range of 7.5-30 mg solid.cat./mL), and monitoring reaction parameters and species produced in both the liquid solution and in the gas phase of the reactor head space43 (see FigureS5).Argon was initially bubbled for 30 min, to avoid the presence of air, then CO 2 for approximately 60 min, to saturate the reaction mixture, upon which suspension was irradiated for 5 h under vigorous stirring at room temperature.Initial pH value of solution after bubbling was found to be equal to 4.78, and raised to 5.80 after reaction.Under the chosen conditions, nanocomposites proved to be active in converting CO 2 into formic and acetic acids (Scheme 2), while neither simple PEI-grafted nanotubes nor bare TiO 2 displayed appreciable activity (Table5, runs 1-2).The optimal irradiaton time of 5 h was ascertained by monitoring photoreduction in the first 7 h of reaction (Figure6).Results showed that prolonged reaction times(5 h) led to the decrease of yield in formic acid with the corresponding increment of acetic acid.A plausible explanation could be related to the partial transformation of HCOOH into CH 3 COOH by reaction with methyl radicals (CH 3 ), according to the general mechanism proposed by S. Sharifnia et al.52. Figure 5. Absorbance spectra in Kubelka-Munk units of photocatalytic materials Scheme 2: Photoreduction of carbon dioxide. Scheme 2. Photoreduction of carbon dioxide.
