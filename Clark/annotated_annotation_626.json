The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Pt/TiO 2 and Cu/TiO 2 were identified on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.1542 nm) at a scan rate of 1min -1 .The specific surface area of the prepared samples was estimated by N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer.The surface morphology of the catalysts was investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 450).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Shimadzu/ KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W equipped with Al/Mg K radiation.The UV-vis absorption spectra of the catalysts were obtained with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 950).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the catalysts were recorded at room temperature on a confocal laser Raman microscope (Horiba JobinYvon, LabRAM HR800).A 325-nm He-Cd laser source was used to excite the material in the PL test. The photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO 2 was carried out in a modified twin reactor (as shown in Fig. 1).Details of the reactor have been described elsewhere in the cited literature 11,17.First, 200 mL of a 2 mM Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 and a 2 mM FeSO 4 solution were adjusted to a pH of 2.6 by adding concentrated H 2 SO 4 , and then placed in the O 2 -generation and CO 2 -hydrogenation sides, respectively.A Nafion membrane (Nafion 117) was used to divide and connect the two compartments.Pt/WO 3 (300 mg) was dispersed in the Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 solution as an O 2 -photocatalyst.Metal (Pt or Cu)-loaded TiO 2 (20 mg) was suspended in the FeSO 4 solution as a H 2 -photocatalyst and spread on an elevated rectangular quartz plate (6 cm 2 ) in the gaseous phase as a CO 2 -photocatalyst.The aqueous phase of both sides was under agitation during the reaction.Prior to irradiation, ultra-pure Ar (99.9995) and CO 2 (99.9992) were bubbled into the solutions of O 2 -generation and CO 2hydrogenation compartments, respectively.Two 300 W xenon lamps (Newport, Model 66902) with AM 1.5G filters installed were placed on the side of the reactors and utilized as the light source in this study.The measured light irradiance was approximately 90 mW/cm 2 , and the irradiation time was 4 h. The gas samples were taken at 1 h intervals using a 1 mL gas-tight syringe.The oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Molecular Sieve 5A column.The CO and hydrocarbons were analyzed by another gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a methanizer, and a Porapak QS packed column. The photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 hydrogenation with H 2 was also performed in a batch cylindrical reactor (internal volume: 275 mL, Fig. 2), which was illuminated by a 9 W Hg lamp ( 254 nm, UVP, Pen-Ray 11SC-1) located in the center of a quartz tube.In the case of the hydrogen evolution (Fig. 2A), 20 mg of the catalyst was suspended in deionized water (100 mL) under magnetic stirring.Prior to irradiation, the solution was pre-purged by ultra-pure Ar for 30 min to expel the air from the reactor. In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 and water, the catalyst was placed in a 25-mL beaker and set at the bottom of the reactor (Fig. 2B).H 2 was injected into the reactor by using a syringe, and the concentration of H 2 was analyzed by GC-TCD to ensure that 1 vol. of H 2 was in the reactor.Deionized water (5 mL) was added in the region between the beaker and the reactor.The analytical method was the same as that used in the twin reactor.No water was added in the reactor in the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 in the absence of water,", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Cu/TiO2", "source": "The results from the single reactor showed that Pt/TiO 2 had a higher H 2 production than Cu/TiO 2 .", "context": "In this study, a modified twin reactor was utilized for the photoreduction of CO 2 into solar fuels using the H 2 produced from photocatalytic water splitting.The most dominant advantage of the twin reactor was that CO 2 hydrogenation was separated from water splitting in different phases, which enabled us to control the CO 2 hydrogenation and water splitting reactions independently by using two different photocatalysts, i.e., Cu/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 .The results from the single reactor showed that Pt/TiO 2 had a higher H 2 production than Cu/TiO 2 .For CO 2 hydrogenation, Cu/TiO 2 was more effective toward the reduction of CO 2 to CO, while Pt/TiO 2 tended to promote the production of CH 4 .Finally, the results in the twin reactor system indicate that the existence of the H 2 -photocatalyst and the CO 2 -photocatalyst in different phases significantly promoted CO 2 reduction.The highest CO 2 reduction activity was achieved by using Pt/TiO 2 as the H 2 -photocatalyst and Cu/TiO 2 as the CO 2 -photocatalyst.Consequently, the high QE was attributed to the simultaneous enhancement of H 2 evolution and CO 2 hydrogenation.
