Carbonaceous supports were first functionalized with Poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) in NaBH 4 .Afterwards, Pt precursor (H 2 PtCl 6 ) was adsorbed on the surface of the functionalized supports by the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged PAH functional groups and negatively charged PtCl 6 2A ions. Finally, PtCl 6 2A ions were reduced in presence of the ethylene glycol leading to deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the support surface.The details of the synthesis process are explained below. The C-PAH (C14SWCNT, MWCNT, AC and rGO) was prepared by simultaneous sonication and vigorous stirring of mixture of the 300 mg carbonaceous material and 500 ml aqueous solution of 0.5 wt PAH at 70 C. 25 ml of 1M NaBH 4 solution was subsequently added and the solution was stirred for 24 h.Finally, C-PAH was collected using a centrifuge, washed with deionized water to remove excess PAH, and dried at 90 C in vacuum for 3 h.Surface amine functional groups of PAH were generated through this step. Typically, 1980 mg of C-PAH and 79 mg of TiO 2 were added to a solution of 0.1 mmol H 2 PtCl 6 in EG. 1 M NaOH solution in EG was used to keep the solution pH above 12.At high pH conditions, oxidization of EG resulted in glycolate anions release which strongly stabilize Pt nanoparticles 33,34.After 1 h of stirring, solution reflux conditions were established at 130 C for 4 h.Once cooled down, the solution pH was decreased and kept at lower than 3 by adding HNO 3 solution.After 48 h of stirring, the resulting material was washed with deionized water for complete removal of Cl ions and subsequently dried under vacuum at 90 C for 24 h. Typically, 3 g of C-PAH was dispersed in 30 ml of deionized water by sonication.Afterwards, 1 g of TiO 2 was sonicated in 20 ml of 1 M solution of HCL and was slowly added into the C-PAH suspension during 10 min of vigorous stirring.Subsequently, stirring was slowed down and the mixture was stirred for 48 h.Finally, the resulting material was collected by a centrifuge and washed with ethanol and deionized water, and dried under vacuum at 90 C for 24 h. 5 wt Pt/TiO 2 sample was prepared by photodeposition method.Typically, 2.5 ml of 8 wt aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 was added to 100 ml of deionized water followed by N 2 gas bubbling for 15 min.Subsequently, 2 g of TiO 2 and 50 ml of methanol was added under vigorous stirring and irradiation of 300 W Xe lamp for 2 h.After photodeposition of Pt on TiO 2 , the light grayish suspension was centrifuged and Pt/TiO 2 was collected and washed with methanol and deionized water for several times and subsequently dried under vacuum at 90 C for 24 h.

Typically, 1980 mg of C-PAH and 79 mg of TiO 2 were added to a solution of 0.1 mmol H 2 PtCl 6 in EG. 1 M NaOH solution in EG was used to keep the solution pH above 12.At high pH conditions, oxidization of EG resulted in glycolate anions release which strongly stabilize Pt nanoparticles 33,34.After 1 h of stirring, solution reflux conditions were established at 130 C for 4 h.Once cooled down, the solution pH was decreased and kept at lower than 3 by adding HNO 3 solution.After 48 h of stirring, the resulting material was washed with deionized water for complete removal of Cl ions and subsequently dried under vacuum at 90 C for 24 h. Typically, 3 g of C-PAH was dispersed in 30 ml of deionized water by sonication.Afterwards, 1 g of TiO 2 was sonicated in 20 ml of 1 M solution of HCL and was slowly added into the C-PAH suspension during 10 min of vigorous stirring.Subsequently, stirring was slowed down and the mixture was stirred for 48 h.Finally, the resulting material was collected by a centrifuge and washed with ethanol and deionized water, and dried under vacuum at 90 C for 24 h. 5 wt Pt/TiO 2 sample was prepared by photodeposition method.Typically, 2.5 ml of 8 wt aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 was added to 100 ml of deionized water followed by N 2 gas bubbling for 15 min.Subsequently, 2 g of TiO 2 and 50 ml of methanol was added under vigorous stirring and irradiation of 300 W Xe lamp for 2 h.After photodeposition of Pt on TiO 2 , the light grayish suspension was centrifuged and Pt/TiO 2 was collected and washed with methanol and deionized water for several times and subsequently dried under vacuum at 90 C for 24 h. A Zeiss EM900 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with accelerating voltage of 80 keV was used to obtain TEM micrographs.TEM images were analyzed by the Digital Micrograph software package (Gatan Inc.) using at least 100 particles imaged for each sample to determine the average diameter.A Zen 3600 Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments) was used to measure the zeta potentials.Xray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a PW3040/60 X'Pert PRO MPD (PANalytical) diffractometer using a Cu Ka radiation source (l 14 1.5406 A) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA.A continuous mode was used for data collection in 2q range of 20 to 100 at a scanning speed of 10 per minute.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were evaluated by N 2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms at A196 C using a Belsorp mini II apparatus.Prior to analysis, samples were de-gassed at 120 C for 15 h.Ultra violet-visible (UVevis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) spectra were obtained in the wavelength range of 200e800 nm at ambient temperature using an Agilent Cary 100 UVevis spectrophotometer The Kubelka-Munk function F(R) was used to determine the band gap energies of the photocatalysts, i.e. the plot of F(R)hn 0.5 versus hn (Tauc plot) was extrapolated. CO2 photoreduction experiments were performed in a continuous gas-phase fixed-bed photoreactor setup at 1 bar and 25 C. First, 100 mg of catalyst powder was placed in the quartz reactor.Afterwards, high-purity (99.99)CO2 gas was bubbled through a water bubbler to produce a mixture of CO2 and a sacrificial reagent (water vapor).Prior to irradiation, CO2 was purged into the reactor (50 ml min A1 for 1 h) in order to guarantee the complete elimination of air from reactor system while ensuring the complete adsorption of CO2 molecules on the surface of the catalyst.Subsequently, CO2 flow rate was set to 50 ml min A1 .The visible light irradiation source was a 15 W energy-saving daylight lamp (Philips) that was turned on for 12 h.The light intensity was measured by a pyranometer (Kipp and Zonen type CMP 6).The average intensity of the light was measured to be 8.5 mW cm A2 and the distance between light source and photoreactor in all cases was fixed to 5 cm.The product gas was swept by He as a carrier gas for online gas analysis.A Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a Hayesep Q and a Molecular Sieve column was used for product gas analysis using thermal conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization FID detectors. In order to ensure the sole formation of CH4 from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction with water vapor under visible light irradiation, control experiments were carried out under conditions of eliminating (a) visible light irradiation, (b) photocatalyst, (c) CO2 (substituting N2 for CO2) and (d) water vapor.For all control experiments, there was no evidence of CH4 formation.The following definition for CH 4 yield was used to compare the performance of the photocatalysts: CH 4 yield 14 Molar flow rate of CH 4 produced Amount of photocatalyst used A 100 The reported data are mean value of 3 experiments with error bars indicating one standard deviation.", "vote": "1"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The C-PAH (C14SWCNT, MWCNT, AC and rGO) was prepared by simultaneous sonication and vigorous stirring of mixture of the 300 mg carbonaceous material and 500 ml aqueous solution of 0.5 wt PAH at 70 C.", "context": "SWCNT, MWCNT, activated carbon (AC), graphite powder, Poly (allylamine hydrochloride) average MW of 56000, ethylene glycol (EG), Hexachloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O) and Anatase TiO 2 were purchased from SigmaeAldrich.Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were synthesized from graphite powder by a modified Hummers' method 31,32.
