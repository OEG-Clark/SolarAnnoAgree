The dimension of the cylindrical monolith is 60 mm diameter and 20 mm long.The cell density of the cordierite ceramic monoliths with square channels, purchased from the Pingxiang Meitao Company China, is 100 and 200 CPSI (cells per square inch).Before coating, the monoliths were washed with acetone and isopropanol to remove any organic materials and then dried at 80 C for 12 h.Next, the dried monoliths were immersed into the sol.Any excess sol was blown off using hot compressed air.The coating procedure was repeated to ensure constant loading.The coated monolith was dried at 80 C for 12 h before calcination at a rate of 5 C min A1 up to 500 C, held for 5 h.The catalyst loading was calculated by subtracting coated monolith weight from the initial bare monolith weight.For every coating, three readings were recorded for both bare and coated monoliths with their average values reported.Different In and Ni doping levels were prepared by varying the quantity of In(NO 3 ) 3 A3H 2 O and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O.The amounts of In-used were 1 wt., 2 wt., 3.5 wt., and 5 wt..Similarly, in co-loading of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts, nickel doping levels were 0.5 wt., 1 wt. and 2 wt. at fixed In-doping (3.5 wt.).For comparison, pure TiO 2 was prepared by employing the same procedure without metal doping. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the catalyst samples were obtained from Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu-Ka radiation, wavelength k 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The scanning rate was 1.2min A1 from 10 to 70of 2h.The crystalline phases were identified based on powder diffraction data (JCPDS-ICSD) reference.Meanwhile, Scherrer equation was applied to calculate TiO 2 crystal size.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out with JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM instrument.The Brunauer-E mmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size of the cata-lysts was measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer.The XPS measurement was performed using Omicron DAR 400 analyzer.The photocatalyst was fixed to the sample holder using carbon tape.The pass energy used was 20 eV while the instrument was operated at 15 kV.The survey spectra were recorded in the range of 0-1400 eV.The binding energies were calibrated against the C1s signal (284.6 eV) as the internal standard.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of the samples were determined using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere.Initially, blank runs were conducted to correct the base line.The absorbance spectra were analyzed at ambient temperature in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were determined from the extrapolation of Tauc plot to the abscissa of photon energy.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer. The monolith photoreactor system for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 consisted of a cylindrical stainless steel chamber with 5.5 cm length and a total volume of 150 cm 3 as previously described 8.The catalyst-coated monolith was placed inside the cylindrical stainless steel chamber with a quartz window for passing light irradiations.The light source for UV irradiation was a 200 W Hg reflector lamp.The lamp was equipped with cooling fans to remove heat from the lamp.The straight square cordierite monolith channels were illuminated with the flux of the reflected light source.An optical process monitor ILT OPM-1D and a SED008/ W sensor were placed above the upper surface of the monolith to measure the light intensity entering into the channels.The total light influx passing at the top of the reactor was measured to be 150 mW cm A2 .The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure lights for the reactions came through the quartz window only.In case of the cell type photoreactor, the reactor chamber and the light source were the same as that of the monolith reactor.However, 50 mg of catalyst powder was suspended uniformly at the bottom of the reactor to ensure light is distributed over the catalyst surface. Before feeding, the reactor was purged with helium (He).A mixture of gases (CO 2 , H 2 and He, purity 99.99) was passed through the reactor for a specific time to saturate the catalysts at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.The performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 monolith photoreactor was investigated in a batch and continuous mode.In a batch mode operation of monolith photoreactor, H 2 concentration was fixed at 20 mol, while CO 2 concentrations of 10, 20, 30 and 40 mol were used to control the CO 2 /H 2 ratios at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0, respectively.He gas was used to culminate the mole balance to 100 mol.The pressure inside the reactor was set to 0.40 bar using a pressure controller for batch mode study.In a continuous monolith photoreactor, the CO 2 /H 2 ratio of 1.0 was adjusted at a feed rate of 20 mL/min and the products were continuously analyzed over the entire irradiation time. A minimum reaction temperature of 100 C was selected for catalyst screening in the RWGS reaction.The effect of reaction temperatures (100, 120 and 140 C) was investigated for determining if the process was thermal, photo-thermal or photocatalysis.The temperature inside the reactor was controlled with a temperature controller. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionized detector (FID).Furthermore, FID detector was connected with a HP-PLOT Q capillary column (Agilent, length 30 m. ID 0.53 mm, film 40 lm) for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffin and olefins hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compounds.The TCD detector was connected to UCW982, DC-200, Porapak Q and Mol Sieve 13X columns.C 1 -C 2 , C 3 -C 5 compounds and light gasses (H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO) were separated using Porapak Q, DC-200 and MS-13X column, respectively.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Nanostructured nickel and indium co-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts", "source": "Nanostructured nickel and indium co-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts with different doping levels and calcination temperature and H 2 as a reducing agent for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were tested for the first time in a monolith photoreactor.", "context": "Nanostructured nickel and indium co-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts with different doping levels and calcination temperature and H 2 as a reducing agent for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were tested for the first time in a monolith photoreactor.Using calcination temperature of 500 C, pure crystalline and anatase phase TiO 2 was produced.Loading NiO and In 2 O 3 metals into TiO 2 produced mesoporous TiO 2 of high surface area and increased pore volume.Both NiO-In 2 O 3 co-doping in TiO 2 has no significant effect on the band gap energy, but promoted the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes efficiently.Significant enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction to CO was observed through RWGS reaction over NiO-In 2 O 3 co-doped TiO 2 in a monolith photoreactor.The formation of CO during CO 2 photo-reduction depended on higher photo-activity of NiO and In 2 O 3 co-metals doped into TiO 2 , higher quantum efficiency of monolith photoreactor and H 2 as reductant.More importantly, the higher CO evolution was probably due to improved charge separation in TiO 2 supported monolith microchannels in the presence of Ni and In ions, which served as electron traps and suppressed electron-hole recombination.The quantum efficiency for CO production was significantly enhanced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts in the monolith photoreactor due to efficient light distribution and harvesting inside micro-channels channels.The stability test revealed yield rates and selectivity of CO partially decreased with more cycles.The new photocatalytic system could improve the CO 2 photoreduction to fuels applications towards one step closer to commercializing photo-technology.

The dimension of the cylindrical monolith is 60 mm diameter and 20 mm long.The cell density of the cordierite ceramic monoliths with square channels, purchased from the Pingxiang Meitao Company China, is 100 and 200 CPSI (cells per square inch).Before coating, the monoliths were washed with acetone and isopropanol to remove any organic materials and then dried at 80 C for 12 h.Next, the dried monoliths were immersed into the sol.Any excess sol was blown off using hot compressed air.The coating procedure was repeated to ensure constant loading.The coated monolith was dried at 80 C for 12 h before calcination at a rate of 5 C min A1 up to 500 C, held for 5 h.The catalyst loading was calculated by subtracting coated monolith weight from the initial bare monolith weight.For every coating, three readings were recorded for both bare and coated monoliths with their average values reported.Different In and Ni doping levels were prepared by varying the quantity of In(NO 3 ) 3 A3H 2 O and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O.The amounts of In-used were 1 wt., 2 wt., 3.5 wt., and 5 wt..Similarly, in co-loading of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts, nickel doping levels were 0.5 wt., 1 wt. and 2 wt. at fixed In-doping (3.5 wt.).For comparison, pure TiO 2 was prepared by employing the same procedure without metal doping. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the catalyst samples were obtained from Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu-Ka radiation, wavelength k 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The scanning rate was 1.2min A1 from 10 to 70of 2h.The crystalline phases were identified based on powder diffraction data (JCPDS-ICSD) reference.Meanwhile, Scherrer equation was applied to calculate TiO 2 crystal size.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out with JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM instrument.The Brunauer-E mmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size of the cata-lysts was measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer.The XPS measurement was performed using Omicron DAR 400 analyzer.The photocatalyst was fixed to the sample holder using carbon tape.The pass energy used was 20 eV while the instrument was operated at 15 kV.The survey spectra were recorded in the range of 0-1400 eV.The binding energies were calibrated against the C1s signal (284.6 eV) as the internal standard.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of the samples were determined using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere.Initially, blank runs were conducted to correct the base line.The absorbance spectra were analyzed at ambient temperature in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were determined from the extrapolation of Tauc plot to the abscissa of photon energy.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer.

The dimension of the cylindrical monolith is 60 mm diameter and 20 mm long.The cell density of the cordierite ceramic monoliths with square channels, purchased from the Pingxiang Meitao Company China, is 100 and 200 CPSI (cells per square inch).Before coating, the monoliths were washed with acetone and isopropanol to remove any organic materials and then dried at 80 C for 12 h.Next, the dried monoliths were immersed into the sol.Any excess sol was blown off using hot compressed air.The coating procedure was repeated to ensure constant loading.The coated monolith was dried at 80 C for 12 h before calcination at a rate of 5 C min A1 up to 500 C, held for 5 h.The catalyst loading was calculated by subtracting coated monolith weight from the initial bare monolith weight.For every coating, three readings were recorded for both bare and coated monoliths with their average values reported.Different In and Ni doping levels were prepared by varying the quantity of In(NO 3 ) 3 A3H 2 O and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O.The amounts of In-used were 1 wt., 2 wt., 3.5 wt., and 5 wt..Similarly, in co-loading of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts, nickel doping levels were 0.5 wt., 1 wt. and 2 wt. at fixed In-doping (3.5 wt.).For comparison, pure TiO 2 was prepared by employing the same procedure without metal doping. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the catalyst samples were obtained from Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu-Ka radiation, wavelength k 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The scanning rate was 1.2min A1 from 10 to 70of 2h.The crystalline phases were identified based on powder diffraction data (JCPDS-ICSD) reference.Meanwhile, Scherrer equation was applied to calculate TiO 2 crystal size.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out with JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM instrument.The Brunauer-E mmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size of the cata-lysts was measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer.The XPS measurement was performed using Omicron DAR 400 analyzer.The photocatalyst was fixed to the sample holder using carbon tape.The pass energy used was 20 eV while the instrument was operated at 15 kV.The survey spectra were recorded in the range of 0-1400 eV.The binding energies were calibrated against the C1s signal (284.6 eV) as the internal standard.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of the samples were determined using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere.Initially, blank runs were conducted to correct the base line.The absorbance spectra were analyzed at ambient temperature in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were determined from the extrapolation of Tauc plot to the abscissa of photon energy.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer.

The dimension of the cylindrical monolith is 60 mm diameter and 20 mm long.The cell density of the cordierite ceramic monoliths with square channels, purchased from the Pingxiang Meitao Company China, is 100 and 200 CPSI (cells per square inch).Before coating, the monoliths were washed with acetone and isopropanol to remove any organic materials and then dried at 80 C for 12 h.Next, the dried monoliths were immersed into the sol.Any excess sol was blown off using hot compressed air.The coating procedure was repeated to ensure constant loading.The coated monolith was dried at 80 C for 12 h before calcination at a rate of 5 C min A1 up to 500 C, held for 5 h.The catalyst loading was calculated by subtracting coated monolith weight from the initial bare monolith weight.For every coating, three readings were recorded for both bare and coated monoliths with their average values reported.Different In and Ni doping levels were prepared by varying the quantity of In(NO 3 ) 3 A3H 2 O and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O.The amounts of In-used were 1 wt., 2 wt., 3.5 wt., and 5 wt..Similarly, in co-loading of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts, nickel doping levels were 0.5 wt., 1 wt. and 2 wt. at fixed In-doping (3.5 wt.).For comparison, pure TiO 2 was prepared by employing the same procedure without metal doping. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the catalyst samples were obtained from Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu-Ka radiation, wavelength k 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The scanning rate was 1.2min A1 from 10 to 70of 2h.The crystalline phases were identified based on powder diffraction data (JCPDS-ICSD) reference.Meanwhile, Scherrer equation was applied to calculate TiO 2 crystal size.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out with JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM instrument.The Brunauer-E mmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size of the cata-lysts was measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer.The XPS measurement was performed using Omicron DAR 400 analyzer.The photocatalyst was fixed to the sample holder using carbon tape.The pass energy used was 20 eV while the instrument was operated at 15 kV.The survey spectra were recorded in the range of 0-1400 eV.The binding energies were calibrated against the C1s signal (284.6 eV) as the internal standard.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of the samples were determined using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere.Initially, blank runs were conducted to correct the base line.The absorbance spectra were analyzed at ambient temperature in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were determined from the extrapolation of Tauc plot to the abscissa of photon energy.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer.
