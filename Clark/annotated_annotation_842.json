View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C9NR10451H In this work, a hierarchical Ni-NiS/C/ZnO photocatalyst was prepared by photodepositing Ni-NiS nanosheets onto electrospun C/ZnO nanofibers.We found that Ni-NiS can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of C/ZnO nanofibers when applied as a cocatalyst.Ni-NiS/C/ZnO favored the adsorption of CO 2 due to chemical adsorption between the cocatalyst and CO 2 molecules.Furthermore, part of the Ni 2 is reduced by e CB-and the cocatalyst Ni-NiS is formed during sample preparation; this cocatalyst serves as an electron sink and suppresses the rapid recombination of e CB-and h VB during the photocatalytic process.Hence, the functions of Ni-NiS are confirmed to increase the adsorption of CO 2 on the cocatalyst Ni-NiS surface and promote e CB-migration from C/ZnO nanofibers to the Ni-NiS nanosheets to CO 2 molecules.Amorphous carbon functions as an electron storage and electron enrichment center due to its good electrical conductivity.Besides, it can effectively remedy the poor light utilization of ZnO by improving its absorbance and broadening its wavelength range.Moreover, the exist of amorphous carbon could reduce the interfacial charge transport resistance and promote the migration ability of photogenerated electrons.Our work provides new insights into approaches to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of ZnO by addition of carbon and loading with the transition metal cocatalyst Ni-NiS.
