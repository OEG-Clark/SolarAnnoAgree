Cocatalysts can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and result in more photoinduced carriers to involve in photocatalytic reaction, thus enhancing photocatalytic activity.Besides, it confirmed that Ag, Pd, Au, Cu 2 O loading exhibited obvious difference on promoting photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution and H 2 evolution, which was ascribed to the different overpotentials of CO evolution and H 2 evolution on photocatalysts.The Pd/HST sample possesses high photocatalytic activity for both CO and H 2 evolution rates due to the low overpotential for CO and H 2 evolution.This work here provides insight into how design photocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O.
