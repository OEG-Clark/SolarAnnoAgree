CN was obtained simply by the calcination of urea.In a typical experiment, 35 g of urea was taken in a ceramic crucible and heated in a muffle furnace at 550 C (1 C min -1 in N 2 ) for 3 h.After that, the obtained CN was milled by mortar to make the caked particles very small. Two grams of the as-obtained CN was dispersed in 150 mL deionized H 2 O with vigorous stirring in a 200-mL round-bottom flask.A certain volume of aqueous H 2 PtCl 6 A6H 2 O solution was then added into the CN suspension drop by drop.The aqueous suspension was stirred (300 rpm) in 80 C water bath in the dark for 1 h.Finally, the product was centrifuged, washed with absolute ethanol repeatedly, and dried at 80 C.The samples were represented by mPt-CN, in which m means the weight ratios of Pt to CN. One gram of as-fabricated CN was dispersed in 20 mL deionized H 2 O with vigorous stirring (450 rpm) in a 60 mL round bottom flask.Different amounts of boric acid with the molar ratios of 2, 5 and 8, respectively, was added and ultrasonically treated for 30 min.Subsequently, the resulting aqueous suspension was transferred into a stainless-steel vessel and kept at 120 C for 2 h.After cooling to room temperature naturally, the product was centrifuged, washed with absolute ethanol, and then dried at 80 C.Finally, (0.5 wt) Pt was loaded on the boric acid modified CN by the same method above.The samples were represented by 0.5Pt-XB-CN, in which X means different molar ratios between boric acid and CN. The synthesis of 0.5Au-XB-CN and 0.5Ag-XB-CN follows the same procedure except using HAuCl 4 and AgNO 3 as raw material. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples were carried out with an XRD Bruker D8 instrument (Germany), using Cu Ka radiation (a 0.15418 nm), at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and an emission current of 20 mA was employed.Electron micrographs were taken on a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV.The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 spectrofluoro-photometer at excitation wavelength of 390 nm.The atmosphere-controlled steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) measurements of the samples were carried out with a home-built apparatus, equipped with a lock-in amplifier (SR830) synchronized with a light chopper (SR540).The powder sample was sandwiched between two indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass electrodes kept in an atmosphere-controlled sealed container.A monochromatic light was obtained from 500 W xenon lamp (CHF XQ500W, Global xenon lamp power) through a double prism monochromator (SBP300). To measure the AOH amount, coumarin trapping fluorescent method was used in which coumarin reacts with AOH radicals to produce 7-hydroxy coumarin to burst fluorescence at approximately 460 nm in photoluminescence spectrum.A 0.05 g amount of each sample powder was dispersed in 40 mL of 0.001 M coumarin aqueous solution contained in a quartz reactor.Prior to irradiation, the reactor was magnetically stirred (300 rpm) for 30 min to attain an adsorption-desorption equilibrium.After irradiation for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged and a certain amount was transferred into a Pyrex glass cell for the fluorescence measurement of 7-hydroxycoumarin at 390 nm excitation wavelength and emission wavelength at 460 nm through a spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer LS 55). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was carried out in an online hydrogen production system (Perfectlight, Beijing, LabSolar II).Eighty milliliters of deionized water and 20 mL methanol were mixed in the cubic glass cell and keep stirring at 400 rpm.Then, 0.1 g of photocatalyst powder was put into the solution.Ahead of the reaction, the mixture was deaerated by evacuation to remove the gas dissolved in water.The experiments were performed by illuminating the mixture solution, using a xenon lamp (300 W) with a 420 CUT filter (420-780 nm) as the visible light source.The amount of evolved H 2 in the photocatalysis process were performed in an inline gas chromatograph (7900, TCD, molecular sieve 5 A , N 2 carrier, Techcomp). In the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , for each experiment, 0.2 g powder sample was dispersed in H 2 O (3 mL) contained in a cylindrical steel reactor with a volume of 100 mL and an area of 3.5 cm 2 .A 300 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source with a cut-off filter (k C 420 nm) for the photocatalytic reaction.High purity CO 2 gas was passed through H 2 O and then entered into the reaction setup for reaching ambient pressure.The used photocatalyst was allowed to equilibrate in the CO 2 /H 2 O system for 1 h.During irradiation, 0.5 mL gas was continually taken from the reaction cell at given time interval for the analyses of CO and O 2 concentration with the help of a gas chromatograph (Tech, GC-7900 with TCD by N 2 gas carrier).Similarly, the amount of CH 4 was detected with FID (GC-2014 with Shimadzu Corp., Japan, with N 2 gas carrier).", "vote": "1"}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "A 0.05 g amount of each sample powder was dispersed in 40 mL of 0.001 M coumarin aqueous solution contained in a quartz reactor.\nIn the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , for each experiment, 0.2 g powder sample was dispersed in H 2 O (3 mL) contained in a cylindrical steel reactor with a volume of 100 mL and an area of 3.5 cm 2 .", "context": "All the reagents including urea, H 2 PtCl 6 A6H 2 O, boric acid and absolute ethanol were of analytical grade and used as-received without further purification.Deionized H 2 O was used throughout the experiments.
