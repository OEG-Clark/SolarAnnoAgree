The highly efficient photocatalytic activities of Cu 2 eTiO 2 nanorod thin films in the reduction process of CO 2 were attributed to the incorporation of Cu 2 ions and one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure which improved the limitations of photon transfer.In addition, the photocatalytic mechanism was discussed to understand the experimental results over the Cu 2 modified TiO 2 nanorod thin films.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 nanorod thin films", "source": "Thus, the TiO 2 nanorod thin films were prepared.", "context": "The growth of oriented TiO 2 nanorod thin films was prepared using a simple hydrothermal method based on the previously reported literature 19,22.However, the synthesis parameters were also improved in this letter.Firstly, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) pieces (F:SnO 2 , 10U/sq, Lixinda Glass China, 25 mm A 30 mm A 1.1 mm) which were ultrasonically washed for 30 min in a mixed solution of ethanol (Chengdu Kelong, China), acetone (SigmaeAldrich) and 2-propanol (Chengdu Kelong, China) with volume ratios of 1:1:1, and 30 min in deionized water respectively.Then the clean FTO pieces were employed as substrates for the growth of TiO 2 nanorods.The substrates were then dried at 100 C at ambient conditions.The reaction solution was prepared by dissolving 40 mL hydrocholoric acid (HCl 36, Chengdu Kelong, China) in 40 mL deionized water.After 30 min magnetic stirring, 1.33 mL of titanium butoxide (97, SigmaeAldrich) was added to the solution based on a method published previously 22.The mixed solution was stirred at ambient conditions until it became transparent.Total reaction solution was taken into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL).The FTO substrates were placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflonliner with the conducting side facing down.The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 C for 6 h in a vacuum drying oven.The FTO substrates were taken out and rinsed extensively with deionized water, and they were allowed to dry in ambient air and followed by annealing in air at 550 C for an additional 3 h with a heating rate of 10 C/min.Thus, the TiO 2 nanorod thin films were prepared. Ultrasonic-assisted sequential cation adsorption method was used for modifying the TiO 2 nanorod thin films 14.Five different concentrations (such as 0.01 M, 0.02 M, 0.03 M, 0.04 M, 0.05 M) of aqueous Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O (Chengdu Kelong, China) solutions were prepared.TiO 2 nanorod thin films were immersed into these solutions for 2 min under ultrasonic concussion, and 2 min in deionised water without ultrasonic concussion.This cycle was repeated 10 times for each sample.After drying at 100 C, the samples were calcined at 400 C in the pipe furnace for 1 h with a heating rate of 10 C/min.The TiO 2 nanorod thin films were named as 0.01 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 , 0.02 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 , 0.03 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 , 0.04 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 and 0.05 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 according to the Cu 2 concentration of the modification solution. The OPMR was fabricated by replica molding method and standard photolithography process 28.The detailed preparation methods of chamber template are as follows.Firstly, the cover plate with branch shaped microchannels was fabricated on silicon wafer (76 mm A 76 mm).Photoresist (SU-8, Microchem Corp.) was spin-coated on the silicon wafer in the coater 7.Before transferring to the photoetching machine, the silicon wafer with photoresist was baked on the heating plate.Then the prepared silicon which was covered with a printed mask was exposed to the UV light followed by a soft-bake process 7.Finally, the silicon wafer was placed in a beaker which was full of developer solvent, and the unexposed photoresist was cleaned out.After post-baking, the terminal silicon substrate with SU-8 of chamber template (26 mm A 30 mm A 0.15 mm) was accomplished.The application of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) used as the cover plate material of the OPMR was described in this paper.Because it has the characteristics of chemical inertness, optical transparence and rapid fabrication which meet all the characteristics to fabricate OPMR. The assembly of the reactor included the following steps.At the first step, polymer base (Sylgard 184 A, Dow Coming) and curingagent (Sylgard 184 B, Dow Coming) were mixed and degassed at a ratio of 10:1.Then the mixture was cast onto the patterned wafer and rectangular mold (3.0 cm A 2.5 cm A 1.1 cm) and all baked at 95 C for 30 min.After that, the PDMS was released from the patterned wafer and rectangular mold.Next, the prepared TiO 2 nanorod thin film was placed on the glass substrate and surrounded by the rectangular PDMS mold.At the last step, the PDMS chamber template was covered on the rectangular PDMS mold.In the center of this chamber, the reaction microchamber volume was totally 117 mL.Fig. 1a shows the design of the OPMR. The connections of FTO to glass substrate and syringe needles to the PDMS plates were enhanced by using UV light adhesive curing under 365 nm UV irradiation to avoid leakage.At both the inlet and outlet, four-branch shaped microchannels were adopted to ensure a uniform filling over the entire microreactor.The image of the fabricated OPMR is given in Fig. 1b. The schematic diagram of the photocatalytic reduction process of CO 2 and water vapor in the OPMR is shown in Fig. 2. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated under UV-light irradiation of a UV-LED with the wavelength of 365 nm (Shanghai Maixin, China).The UV light intensity was controlled by adjusting the distance between the light source and catalyst surface, and the UV light intensity was measured by a UV radiometer (UV-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, China).The whole reaction equipment was wrapped by screen paper to prevent the interference of the outside light.Compressed CO 2 (99.999) which was controlled by a mass flow controller (Omega, America) was passed through a boiling flask-3-neck to generate the mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.The ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 was adjusted by controlling the temperature in the boiling flask-3neck which was equipped with armored thermocouple A. The temperature of the gaseous mixture in the boiling flask-3-neck was controlled by the oilbath device, and the temperature was kept at 60 C in this paper, hence the ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 was kept at 1:10.The gaseous mixture was then introduced to the OPMR and operated in a continuous-flow mold.Thereinto, the flow rate of the gaseous mixture was achieved by controlling the flow of CO 2 .The gaseous mixture was flowed through the OPMR for at least 1 h before illumination to ensure that there was only water vapor and CO 2 in the OPMR.The function of the heating tape was to ensure that water vapor did not appear condensation in the process from the boiling flask-3neck to OPMR as shown in Fig. 2. The temperature in the OPMR was controlled by the constant temperature heating system.Each experiment was carried out for 6 h.The collection vessel was equipped with 1 mL deionized water, which acted as solvent to collect the products from the OPMR.Then the methanol concentration and ethanol concentration at the collection vessel were measured by gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, Shimadzu, Japan).The gas chromatograph was equipped with a SH-Rtx-Wax, 30 m length, 0.25 mm inside diameter and a 0.25 mm film capillary column.All experiments were repeated three times.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 nanorod thin films", "source": "The photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanorod thin films photocatalyst were evaluated by the reduction yield in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor under UV irradiation.", "context": "In this study, the 1D TiO 2 nanostructure array thin films with doped Cu 2 in OPMR were used for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor.The photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanorod thin films photocatalyst were evaluated by the reduction yield in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor under UV irradiation.Methanol and ethanol were found to be the major products.The maximum methanol and ethanol yields were 36.18mmol/g-cat h and 79.13 mmol/g-cat h at a flow rate of 2 mL/min which was under the reaction temperature of 80 C and under the light intensity of 15 mW/cm 2 by using the 0.02 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 nanorod thin films.Effects of different Cu 2 doping concentrations, CO 2 flow rates and reaction temperatures were investigated.The optimal Cu 2 loading on the TiO 2 nanorods was found to be 1.5 wt. in our experiments.It was conceived that Cu 2 ions were served as active sites of electron traps and could suppress the electronehole recombination.At the same time, the band gap energy of the TiO 2 nanorods decreased with the increase of the concentration of doped Cu 2 .The absorption spectra of the doped TiO 2 nanorods were extended to the visible light.The reaction could not only promote the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface, but also promote the desorption of the reaction products at the optimal flow rate.And the increasing of temperature could promote the adsorption of CO 2 and accelerate photogenerated species.Experiments results showed that the yields of Table 1 e Comparison of the methanol and ethanol yields with existing works.methanol and ethanol in this study were much higher than the previous studies.The reason of this significantly enhanced CO 2 photoreduction rates was due to the synergistic combination of Cu 2 deposition, high surface area of TiO 2 nanorods and enhanced mass transfer of OPMR.Combination of 1D TiO 2 nanostructure array thin films and OPMR is found to be feasible, industrial scale-up and attractive for use in further investigation of CO 2 photoreduction for solving environmental problems.

Ultrasonic-assisted sequential cation adsorption method was used for modifying the TiO 2 nanorod thin films 14.Five different concentrations (such as 0.01 M, 0.02 M, 0.03 M, 0.04 M, 0.05 M) of aqueous Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O (Chengdu Kelong, China) solutions were prepared.TiO 2 nanorod thin films were immersed into these solutions for 2 min under ultrasonic concussion, and 2 min in deionised water without ultrasonic concussion.This cycle was repeated 10 times for each sample.After drying at 100 C, the samples were calcined at 400 C in the pipe furnace for 1 h with a heating rate of 10 C/min.The TiO 2 nanorod thin films were named as 0.01 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 , 0.02 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 , 0.03 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 , 0.04 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 and 0.05 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 according to the Cu 2 concentration of the modification solution. The OPMR was fabricated by replica molding method and standard photolithography process 28.The detailed preparation methods of chamber template are as follows.Firstly, the cover plate with branch shaped microchannels was fabricated on silicon wafer (76 mm A 76 mm).Photoresist (SU-8, Microchem Corp.) was spin-coated on the silicon wafer in the coater 7.Before transferring to the photoetching machine, the silicon wafer with photoresist was baked on the heating plate.Then the prepared silicon which was covered with a printed mask was exposed to the UV light followed by a soft-bake process 7.Finally, the silicon wafer was placed in a beaker which was full of developer solvent, and the unexposed photoresist was cleaned out.After post-baking, the terminal silicon substrate with SU-8 of chamber template (26 mm A 30 mm A 0.15 mm) was accomplished.The application of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) used as the cover plate material of the OPMR was described in this paper.Because it has the characteristics of chemical inertness, optical transparence and rapid fabrication which meet all the characteristics to fabricate OPMR. The assembly of the reactor included the following steps.At the first step, polymer base (Sylgard 184 A, Dow Coming) and curingagent (Sylgard 184 B, Dow Coming) were mixed and degassed at a ratio of 10:1.Then the mixture was cast onto the patterned wafer and rectangular mold (3.0 cm A 2.5 cm A 1.1 cm) and all baked at 95 C for 30 min.After that, the PDMS was released from the patterned wafer and rectangular mold.Next, the prepared TiO 2 nanorod thin film was placed on the glass substrate and surrounded by the rectangular PDMS mold.At the last step, the PDMS chamber template was covered on the rectangular PDMS mold.In the center of this chamber, the reaction microchamber volume was totally 117 mL.Fig. 1a shows the design of the OPMR. The connections of FTO to glass substrate and syringe needles to the PDMS plates were enhanced by using UV light adhesive curing under 365 nm UV irradiation to avoid leakage.At both the inlet and outlet, four-branch shaped microchannels were adopted to ensure a uniform filling over the entire microreactor.The image of the fabricated OPMR is given in Fig. 1b.

The temperature of the gaseous mixture in the boiling flask-3-neck was controlled by the oilbath device, and the temperature was kept at 60 C in this paper, hence the ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 was kept at 1:10.The gaseous mixture was then introduced to the OPMR and operated in a continuous-flow mold.Thereinto, the flow rate of the gaseous mixture was achieved by controlling the flow of CO 2 .The gaseous mixture was flowed through the OPMR for at least 1 h before illumination to ensure that there was only water vapor and CO 2 in the OPMR.The function of the heating tape was to ensure that water vapor did not appear condensation in the process from the boiling flask-3neck to OPMR as shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 4d.The High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of the 0.02 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 nanorod is clearly shown in Fig. 5f.The d spacing was measured to be 0.25 nm which correspond to 002 plane of the monoclinic CuO31,32.The optical properties of all the TiO 2 nanorod thin films were measured by using UVevis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV-2100, UVeVis spectrophotometer) with BaSO 4 as the reference standard.As depicted in Fig.6, the UVevis spectra of the pure TiO 2 nanorod thin film showed the lowest absorption among the thin films, The absorption spectrum of pure TiO 2 nanorod thin film appeared around 411 nm, which had red shift compared with intrinsic anatase TiO 2 (387 nm).Moreover, visible light absorption has increased with the increase of concentration of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O solution.Red shift observed for the increasing amount of Cu 2 of the thin film samples shows that the band gap energy of the samples is decreased gradually.The direct band gap energy of the samples is calculated by using equation shown in Eq. (1)33. Fig. 5 e TEM images of a single TiO 2 nanorod (a, b) and 0.02 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 nanorods (d, e), HR-TEM images of small TiO 2 nanorods (c) and 0.02 M Cu 2 eTiO 2 nanorods (f).
