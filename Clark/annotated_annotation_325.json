All the samples have been prepared by precipitation method maintaining pH constant and equal to 7. In a typical synthesis, a 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M ammonia solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep the desired pH.In this way the precipitation agent acts as nitrogen source as well.The Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered, and washed with distilled water to remove sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of barium chloride test 73.Wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow.This sample has been labelled NT where N indicates the precipitating agent (ammonia solution) and T stands for titanium dioxide.Nitrogen amount in all the samples is 0.4 wt. as previously reported 32. Different amounts of copper have been introduced by means of incipient wetness impregnation using copper nitrate trihydrated before calcination: the chosen metal amounts are: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 wt. Cu/TiO 2 ratio.The sample obtained are labelled 0.1CuNT, 0.2CuNT, 0.4CuNT and 0.6CuNT respectively: the number represents the wt. amount of metal. Using the same methodology, a nitrogen-free sample has been synthesized using NaOH 9.0 M solution as a precipitation agent.This sample has been labelled NaT, where Na stands for the precipitating agent. Thermal analyses (TG/DTA) were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG instrument in air flux (20 mL/min) using a temperature rate set at 5 C/min in the 25-800 C temperature range. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected employing a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu Ka radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm respectively.Data scans were performed in the 2u range 5-75 with 0.02 stepsize and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination were performed by the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at A196 C were performed using a MICROMERITICS ASAP 2000 analyzer in order to obtain information on surface area and pore volume.Prior to N 2 physisorption experiments, all samples were outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.Mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.Surface area was calculated using the standard BET 74 equation method and pore size distribution was elaborated using the BJH method applied to the isotherms desorption branch 75. The real copper amount of co-doped catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) after microwave dissolution of the samples using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100.The amount of nitrogen was obtained by elemental analyses with a Carlo Erba CNS Autoanalyser, mod.NA 1500.All analyses were replicated 2-3 times and the precision was 95. TPR experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment: samples (50 mg) were heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mL/min STP).The effluent gases were analyzed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of carefully ground powders was performed with a Thermo Scientific Evolution 600 spectrophotometer, equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory Praying-Mantis sampling kit (Harrick Scientific Products, USA).A Spectralon 1 disk was used as reference material.The experimental absorption versus lambda plot was elaborated using the Kubelka-Munk function 76.The band gap energy (E g ) of the catalysts are determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge and they can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/ l) and photon energy (E g 1240/l). XPS Surface characterization was performed by means of an XPS instrument (M-Probe-SSI) equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka source (1486.6 eV) with a spot size of 200 A 750 mm and a pass energy of 25 eV, providing a resolution for 0.74 eV.For all the samples, the C1s peak level was taken as internal reference at 284.6 eV.The accuracy of the reported binding energies (BE) can be estimated to be AE0.2 eV.The quantitative data were also accurately checked and reproduced several times and the percentages error is estimated to be AE1 thanks for a severe confidence in spectral decomposition. (High-Resolution) Transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained employing a JEOL JEM 3010UHR (300 kV) TEM, equipped with a single crystal LaB 6 filament and an Oxford INCA Energy TEM 200 energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector.All samples were dry deposited on Cu \"holey\" carbon grids (200 mesh). Carbon dioxide photoreduction reactions have been carried out in a borate glass tubular fixed bed reactor (diameter 4 mm, length 40 mm) using in each test 400 mg of sample, that have been previously pressed, ground and sieved to 50-70 mesh (0.2-0.3 mm).Catalysts have been loaded and left under a 2 mL/min helium flow for 20 h in order to induce the desorption of adsorbed molecules from atmosphere. Samples have been lighted using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (emission range 315-400 nm has been shielded by a special tubolar quartz, purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l., to select the wavelength of 366 nm), with an average irradiance of 50 W/m 2 , controlled with a Delta Ohm HD 2302.0 photo-radiometer and a LP 471 probe.In a preliminary test, it has been carefully considered light absorption provided by the reactor itself.It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it: thus it is possible to state that the reactor walls not adsorb the light. Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).When the system reached the equilibrium state, the reactor was closed and this was taken as the beginning of the reaction.In other terms, the reaction is not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it takes place in static conditions.Within the sealed reactor, there are 9.2 mmol of CO 2 and 0.7 mmol of H 2 O. The reaction has been monitored for 2, 4 and 6 h.Reaction products have been analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Analysis conditions have been carefully tuned in order to deliver a good separation of reagents and products and in all the analyses, reagents and products amount is above detection and quantification limits. Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in nmol CH4 /g cat , as commonly used in literature 77,78. In order to study the reaction conditions the carbon dioxide mass flow has been reduced and the water vapour flow has been preserved.To do so, CO 2 has been diluted with an inert (helium) in order to keep total gas mixture flow constant: in this way, temperature in H 2 O saturator has not been changed.The tested CO 2 /H 2 O ratios have been reported in the chart below.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "N doped Cu-photocatalysts", "source": "this work has investigated the N doped Cu-photocatalysts suitable for carbon dioxide photoreduction with water in gas phase in very mild reaction condition.", "context": "Motivated by the two most challenging issues of our society, namely CO 2 pollution and fossil fuels depletion, this work has investigated the N doped Cu-photocatalysts suitable for carbon dioxide photoreduction with water in gas phase in very mild reaction condition.This technology is potentially a winning solution from both the environmental and the energy-efficiency viewpoints. Through a simple and inexpensive synthetic strategy, the catalytic activity of titania has been improved adding a dopant (N) and a co-catalyst (CuO).In two different ways, both these modifications proved to be effective in upgrading titania catalytic performances.The catalysts selectivity (CH 4 , H 2 ) and productivity can be controlled by tuning conveniently the reactions conditions.In particular, the CO 2 /H 2 O ratio is a crucial parameter. Therefore this work opens the doors to further studies in order to exploit the enormous potentialities of CO 2 photoreduction with water. !

Carbon dioxide photoreduction reactions have been carried out in a borate glass tubular fixed bed reactor (diameter 4 mm, length 40 mm) using in each test 400 mg of sample, that have been previously pressed, ground and sieved to 50-70 mesh (0.2-0.3 mm).Catalysts have been loaded and left under a 2 mL/min helium flow for 20 h in order to induce the desorption of adsorbed molecules from atmosphere. Samples have been lighted using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (emission range 315-400 nm has been shielded by a special tubolar quartz, purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l., to select the wavelength of 366 nm), with an average irradiance of 50 W/m 2 , controlled with a Delta Ohm HD 2302.0 photo-radiometer and a LP 471 probe.In a preliminary test, it has been carefully considered light absorption provided by the reactor itself.It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it: thus it is possible to state that the reactor walls not adsorb the light. Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).When the system reached the equilibrium state, the reactor was closed and this was taken as the beginning of the reaction.In other terms, the reaction is not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it takes place in static conditions.Within the sealed reactor, there are 9.2 mmol of CO 2 and 0.7 mmol of H 2 O. The reaction has been monitored for 2, 4 and 6 h.Reaction products have been analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Analysis conditions have been carefully tuned in order to deliver a good separation of reagents and products and in all the analyses, reagents and products amount is above detection and quantification limits. Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in nmol CH4 /g cat , as commonly used in literature 77,78. In order to study the reaction conditions the carbon dioxide mass flow has been reduced and the water vapour flow has been preserved.To do so, CO 2 has been diluted with an inert (helium) in order to keep total gas mixture flow constant: in this way, temperature in H 2 O saturator has not been changed.The tested CO 2 /H 2 O ratios have been reported in the chart below.", "vote": "1"}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "mercury", "source": "Samples have been lighted using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (emission range 315-400 nm has been shielded by a special tubolar quartz, purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l., to select the wavelength of 366 nm), with an average irradiance of 50 W/m 2 , controlled with a Delta Ohm HD 2302.0 photo-radiometer and a LP 471 probe.", "context": "The following reagents were used as received: TiOSO 4 xH 2 O yH 2 SO 4 (Ti assay 29, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide solution (33, Riedel-de-Haen), sodium hydroxide (assay 97, Carlo Erba) and Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O (assay 99, Sigma-Aldrich).A standard TiO 2 reference material has been purchased by Euro Support s.r.o.It has been chosen to use this commercial sample as a reference since it is a titanium dioxide characterised by a wide surface area (339 m 2 /g) and anatase as crystalline phase.

Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).When the system reached the equilibrium state, the reactor was closed and this was taken as the beginning of the reaction.In other terms, the reaction is not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it takes place in static conditions.Within the sealed reactor, there are 9.2 mmol of CO 2 and 0.7 mmol of H 2 O. The reaction has been monitored for 2, 4 and 6 h.Reaction products have been analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Analysis conditions have been carefully tuned in order to deliver a good separation of reagents and products and in all the analyses, reagents and products amount is above detection and quantification limits. Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in nmol CH4 /g cat , as commonly used in literature 77,78. In order to study the reaction conditions the carbon dioxide mass flow has been reduced and the water vapour flow has been preserved.To do so, CO 2 has been diluted with an inert (helium) in order to keep total gas mixture flow constant: in this way, temperature in H 2 O saturator has not been changed.The tested CO 2 /H 2 O ratios have been reported in the chart below.", "vote": "1"}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "When the system reached the equilibrium state, the reactor was closed and this was taken as the beginning of the reaction.\nIn other terms, the reaction is not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it takes place in static conditions.", "context": "The following reagents were used as received: TiOSO 4 xH 2 O yH 2 SO 4 (Ti assay 29, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide solution (33, Riedel-de-Haen), sodium hydroxide (assay 97, Carlo Erba) and Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O (assay 99, Sigma-Aldrich).A standard TiO 2 reference material has been purchased by Euro Support s.r.o.It has been chosen to use this commercial sample as a reference since it is a titanium dioxide characterised by a wide surface area (339 m 2 /g) and anatase as crystalline phase. All the samples have been prepared by precipitation method maintaining pH constant and equal to 7. In a typical synthesis, a 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M ammonia solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep the desired pH.In this way the precipitation agent acts as nitrogen source as well.The Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered, and washed with distilled water to remove sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of barium chloride test 73.Wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow.This sample has been labelled NT where N indicates the precipitating agent (ammonia solution) and T stands for titanium dioxide.Nitrogen amount in all the samples is 0.4 wt. as previously reported 32. Different amounts of copper have been introduced by means of incipient wetness impregnation using copper nitrate trihydrated before calcination: the chosen metal amounts are: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 wt. Cu/TiO 2 ratio.The sample obtained are labelled 0.1CuNT, 0.2CuNT, 0.4CuNT and 0.6CuNT respectively: the number represents the wt. amount of metal. Using the same methodology, a nitrogen-free sample has been synthesized using NaOH 9.0 M solution as a precipitation agent.This sample has been labelled NaT, where Na stands for the precipitating agent. Thermal analyses (TG/DTA) were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG instrument in air flux (20 mL/min) using a temperature rate set at 5 C/min in the 25-800 C temperature range. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected employing a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu Ka radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm respectively.Data scans were performed in the 2u range 5-75 with 0.02 stepsize and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination were performed by the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at A196 C were performed using a MICROMERITICS ASAP 2000 analyzer in order to obtain information on surface area and pore volume.Prior to N 2 physisorption experiments, all samples were outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.Mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.Surface area was calculated using the standard BET 74 equation method and pore size distribution was elaborated using the BJH method applied to the isotherms desorption branch 75. The real copper amount of co-doped catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) after microwave dissolution of the samples using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100.The amount of nitrogen was obtained by elemental analyses with a Carlo Erba CNS Autoanalyser, mod.NA 1500.All analyses were replicated 2-3 times and the precision was 95. TPR experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment: samples (50 mg) were heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mL/min STP).The effluent gases were analyzed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of carefully ground powders was performed with a Thermo Scientific Evolution 600 spectrophotometer, equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory Praying-Mantis sampling kit (Harrick Scientific Products, USA).A Spectralon 1 disk was used as reference material.The experimental absorption versus lambda plot was elaborated using the Kubelka-Munk function 76.The band gap energy (E g ) of the catalysts are determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge and they can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/ l) and photon energy (E g 1240/l). XPS Surface characterization was performed by means of an XPS instrument (M-Probe-SSI) equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka source (1486.6 eV) with a spot size of 200 A 750 mm and a pass energy of 25 eV, providing a resolution for 0.74 eV.For all the samples, the C1s peak level was taken as internal reference at 284.6 eV.The accuracy of the reported binding energies (BE) can be estimated to be AE0.2 eV.The quantitative data were also accurately checked and reproduced several times and the percentages error is estimated to be AE1 thanks for a severe confidence in spectral decomposition. (High-Resolution) Transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained employing a JEOL JEM 3010UHR (300 kV) TEM, equipped with a single crystal LaB 6 filament and an Oxford INCA Energy TEM 200 energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector.All samples were dry deposited on Cu \"holey\" carbon grids (200 mesh).
