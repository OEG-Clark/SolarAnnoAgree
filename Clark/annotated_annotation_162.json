Fig.3shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized InNbO 4 and NiO and Co 3 O 4 -loaded InNbO 4 catalysts.The XRD patterns of InNbO 4 samples prepared by the solid-state reaction method at 1373 K are well consistent with previously reported monoclinic InNbO 4 pattern and space group P2/c.This indicates that the samples were fully crystallized in the wolframite-type structure Fig. 2.

InNbO 4 had fine Co 3 O 4 clusters on the surface and Co 2 ions in the lattice of NbO 6 .After pretreatment, there was a disappearance of Co 2 and some Co 3 O 4 clusters.The yield of methanol on 1.0 wt Co 3 O 4 -InNbO 4 catalyst decreased after pretreatment.The photocatalytic activity of 1.0 wt Co 3 O 4 -InNbO 4 was lower than that of 1.0 wt NiO-InNbO 4 catalyst, due to the redox property of cobalt cations.

Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a continuous flow reactor.Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of the photoreactor setup.The catalyst powder (0.14 g) was dispersed in a reactant solution (50 ml) in a down-window type irradiation cell made of Pyrex glass (75 ml).A 0.2 M potassium bicarbonate solution was employed as an absorbent of carbon dioxide.Ultra pure CO 2 was passed continuously into the reactor to remove the dissolved oxygen in the reaction medium, and then saturated in the solution of potassium bicarbonate.A cooling system combined with a water pump was used to maintain the temperature of the reactor at room temperature.The reaction mixture was irradiated using 500 W halogen lamp (Everbright; H-500; 143 mW/cm 2 ; l14500-900 nm) as the light source for 20 h.The wavelength-current spectra of 500 W halogen lamp, incident light power probed near reactor were 143 mW/cm 2 as shown in Fig. 2.After 20 h, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to separate the reaction products from the catalyst, and analyzed by a gas chromatography (China Chromatography; GC-8900) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a Porapak QS column.Analysis results indicated that methanol was the only hydrocarbon.Blank reactions were carried out to ensure that hydrocarbon production was solely from the photoreduction of CO 2 .One blank was UV-illuminated without the catalyst, and another was in the dark with the catalyst and CO 2 under the same experimental conditions.No hydrocarbon was detected in the above blank tests.surface and the size of Co species on InNbO 4 was too small to detect.However, the variation in the intensity ratio between (111) and (-111) when compared with bare InNbO 4 could be attributed to the expansion of NbO 6 volume 28,36, and Co species was incorporated into the lattice structure of InNbO 4 .", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "halogen", "source": "Wavelength-current spectra of 500 W halogen lamp, incident light power probed near reactor were 143 mW/cm 2 .", "context": "The present work demonstrated the influence of NiO and Co 3 O 4 co-catalysts and pretreatment on the photocatalytic activity of InNbO 4 for photoreduction of carbon dioxide with water.All the catalysts were pretreated by reducing at 500 1C and oxidizing at 200 1C, respectively.The InNbO 4 and those with cocatalysts were active for photoreduction of CO 2 with water under visible light irradiation.UV-vis DRS confirmed their absorbance in the visible light regime.The absorbance of the sample in visible light region increases after the loading of co-catalyst is a reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity.1.0 wt NiO-InNbO 4 showed the highest photocatalytic activity due to the presence of tiny NiO particles and a small amount of Nb 2 O 5 .However, these tiny NiO particles aggregated to large particles after pretreatment resulting in the decrease of activity.The results showed that the presence of ultra fine NiO particles is beneficial for activity.The ultra fine NiO particles could be obtained using a small amount of NiO.It was found that 0.5 wt NiO-InNbO 4 after pretreatment gave the highest yield of methanol.The high activity of this sample was due to the small NiO particles with coreshell structure, and the presence of Nb 2 O 5 particles that has SMSI between Nb 2 O 5 and Ni metal.Since In 2 O 3 was found to exist in the samples, the influences of In 2 O 3 on the photocatalytic activity should be considered.Actually, the photocatalytic activity of all the samples highly depended on the peak intensity of In 2 O 3 in XRD patterns.The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the existence of In 2 O 3 .The results demonstrated that NiO-InNbO 4 is a promising catalyst for photoreduction of CO 2 under visible light irradiation. Fig.3shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized InNbO 4 and NiO and Co 3 O 4 -loaded InNbO 4 catalysts.The XRD patterns of InNbO 4 samples prepared by the solid-state reaction method at 1373 K are well consistent with previously reported monoclinic InNbO 4 pattern and space group P2/c.This indicates that the samples were fully crystallized in the wolframite-type structure Fig. 2.

InNbO 4 had fine Co 3 O 4 clusters on the surface and Co 2 ions in the lattice of NbO 6 .After pretreatment, there was a disappearance of Co 2 and some Co 3 O 4 clusters.The yield of methanol on 1.0 wt Co 3 O 4 -InNbO 4 catalyst decreased after pretreatment.The photocatalytic activity of 1.0 wt Co 3 O 4 -InNbO 4 was lower than that of 1.0 wt NiO-InNbO 4 catalyst, due to the redox property of cobalt cations.
