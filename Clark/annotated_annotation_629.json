The precipitation method has been chosen to synthesise the titania samples.A 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M NaOH solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep a neutral pH.Then the Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered and washed with distilled water to remove the sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of the barium chloride test 96.The obtained wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow to obtain TiO 2 .This sample has been labelled as TiO 2 . According to a previous work 16, the introduction of copper oxide into titania provides the highest effect on the photoactivity when the Cu amount is 0.2 wt..In particular, incipient wetness impregnation with a copper precursor, namely Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O, has been performed on dried Ti(OH) 4 .Then, the copper-impregnated sample has been calcined at 400 C in air flow in order to obtain the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst. In this case, the incipient wetness method would not allow us to deposit small gold nanoparticles on the titania surface 97.Therefore, in order to obtain small gold nanoparticles, gold has been added to titania by using the deposition-precipitation (DP) method, thus maintaining the pH equal to 8.6 98.Titanium dioxide has been suspended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 3H 2 O for 3 h, while controlling the pH value by the addition of NaOH (0.5 M).The Au amount was 0.2 wt., the same as in the case of the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst, for comparison purposes.After filtration, the samples have been washed with distilled water to remove chlorides.The absence of chlorides was verified by the silver nitrate test.The samples have been dried at 35 C overnight and finally calcined in air for 1 h at 400 C. The final sample has been labelled Au-TiO 2 . The thermal analyses (TG/DTA) have been performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG Instrument (Bavaria, Germany) in air flux (20 mL/min) using a 10 C/min temperature rate between 25-800 C. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns have been collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) (Billerica, MA, USA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu K radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving, and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm, respectively.Data scans have been performed in the 2 range 5-75 with 0.02 step size and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination have been performed using the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS, Billerica, MA, USA) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of the crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 196 C were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyser (Norcross, GA, USA) to obtain information on the surface properties.All samples were previously outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.The mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.The surface area was evaluated using the standard BET 99 equation, and the pore size distribution was obtained using the BJH method applied to the isotherm desorption branch 100. The real amount of copper and gold in the promoted catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100 (Waltham, MA, USA). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment; each sample (50 mg) was heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mLmin -1 STP).The effluent gases were analysed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector (Bethlehem, PA, USA) using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-NIR spectra were collected at r.t. on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 powder as an internal reference, working in the 50,000-4000 cm -1 range.UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the as prepared samples are reported in the Kubelka reflectance of an \"infinitely thick\" layer of the sample 101.The layer of powder sample was made sufficiently thick such that all incident light was absorbed or scattered before reaching the back surface of the sample holder.Typically, a thickness of 1-3 mm was required. The samples in the form of powders were placed in a quartz cell, allowing treatments in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The band gap energy (Eg) of the catalysts was determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge, and it can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/) and photon energy (Eg 1240/). The FTIR analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2000 spectrometer (equipped with a cryogenic MCT detector) (Waltham, MA, USA).As for the analyses at increasing temperature, each sample, in the form of self-supporting pellet, was placed in an AABSPEC 2000 cell allowing to run the spectra in situ in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The samples were outgassed from room temperature up to 150 C. As for the measurements of CO 2 adsorption at room temperature, the samples were submitted to outgassing at r.t. for 1 h in order to remove water, that is, adsorbed at the surface due to the exposition to air.The spectrum of the sample before the inlet of CO 2 was subtracted from each spectrum, and all spectra were normalised with respect to the density of the pellets. The catalytic apparatus was reported in a previous work 16; however, in this paper two new experimental setups, such as the reactor geometry and the catalyst introduction, were used.In the former case a tubular borate glass fixed bed reactor (length 40 mm, diameter 4 mm) was exploited.The catalyst (400 mg) was introduced as small particles with size 0.2-0.3mm.In the latter case, the CO 2 photoreduction was performed using a borate glass thin film reactor (length 33 mm, height 18 mm, thickness 2 mm).Here, the catalyst (10 mg) was inserted by depositing the catalyst suspended in 2-propanol on the light-exposed side of the reactor.2-propanol can act as a hydrogen donor leading to data misinterpretation.To overcome this problem, drying at 110 C for 1 h was sufficient to eliminate all residues of CO 2 photoreduction. The samples were illuminated using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l (Cambiago, Italy).with emission range 315-400 shielded by a special tubular quartz, to select the 366 nm wavelength), with an average irradiance of 50 Wm -2 .It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it; thus, it is possible to state that the reactor walls do not adsorb the light.In performed tests, neither heating nor cooling is used.UV lamp provides a stable and constant temperature of 40 C on the photocatalytic surface.Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).The reactor was closed when the system reached the equilibrium state, and this point was taken as the beginning of the reaction.Therefore, the reaction was not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it took place in static conditions.A total of 9.2 mol of CO 2 and 0.7 mol of H 2 O were present within the sealed reactor.In all catalytic tests, the reaction time was 6 h. The reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in molg cat -1 , as commonly used in literature 102,103, with an average error of 10.Quantum yield () was calculated according to IUPAC recommendations 104, as reported in Equations ( 1) and (2). () required e -CH 4 (mol) incident photons (mol) 100 ( 1) where 8 is the number of required electrons for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , Irr is the irradiance, t is reaction time, A is the illuminated area, radiation wavelength, N A is Avogadro's number, h is Planck's constant, and c is speed of light. The development of an efficient technology for carbon dioxide conversion into solar fuel relies on an integrated and interdisciplinary \"catalysis by design\" approach covering different expertise areas, such as fundamental science and applied engineering.In this paper, two main carbon dioxide photoreduction drawbacks, namely light harvesting and process selectivity, were investigated. Light harvesting was enormously implemented by reactor design; the choice of a thin film reactor enhanced methane enormously, leading to comparable results with those found in literature, despite considerably milder conditions, particularly in terms of irradiance. On the contrary, the material design was fundamental to developing an opportunely designed catalytic system to control the selectivity to the desired product, i.e., methane.Modification of electronic and surface properties allowed us to reach this goal.On one side, the enhanced charge separation observed for Au-TiO 2 seems to negatively affect the activity, resulting in a less negative CB, thus less efficient in CO 2 photoreduction. On the other side, CO 2 adsorption on the catalytic surface represents a critical step that still deserves as much attention as developing greener and highly active catalysts.The CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst matches all these requirements, proving to be more active and selective than the Au-TiO 2 material.The reasons for the enhanced photoactivity could be related to the presence and the abundance of surface sites able to efficiently adsorb and react with the CO 2 reactant.

The precipitation method has been chosen to synthesise the titania samples.A 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M NaOH solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep a neutral pH.Then the Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered and washed with distilled water to remove the sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of the barium chloride test 96.The obtained wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow to obtain TiO 2 .This sample has been labelled as TiO 2 . According to a previous work 16, the introduction of copper oxide into titania provides the highest effect on the photoactivity when the Cu amount is 0.2 wt..In particular, incipient wetness impregnation with a copper precursor, namely Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O, has been performed on dried Ti(OH) 4 .Then, the copper-impregnated sample has been calcined at 400 C in air flow in order to obtain the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst. In this case, the incipient wetness method would not allow us to deposit small gold nanoparticles on the titania surface 97.Therefore, in order to obtain small gold nanoparticles, gold has been added to titania by using the deposition-precipitation (DP) method, thus maintaining the pH equal to 8.6 98.Titanium dioxide has been suspended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 3H 2 O for 3 h, while controlling the pH value by the addition of NaOH (0.5 M).The Au amount was 0.2 wt., the same as in the case of the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst, for comparison purposes.After filtration, the samples have been washed with distilled water to remove chlorides.The absence of chlorides was verified by the silver nitrate test.The samples have been dried at 35 C overnight and finally calcined in air for 1 h at 400 C. The final sample has been labelled Au-TiO 2 . The thermal analyses (TG/DTA) have been performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG Instrument (Bavaria, Germany) in air flux (20 mL/min) using a 10 C/min temperature rate between 25-800 C. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns have been collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) (Billerica, MA, USA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu K radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving, and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm, respectively.Data scans have been performed in the 2 range 5-75 with 0.02 step size and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination have been performed using the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS, Billerica, MA, USA) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of the crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 196 C were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyser (Norcross, GA, USA) to obtain information on the surface properties.All samples were previously outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.The mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.The surface area was evaluated using the standard BET 99 equation, and the pore size distribution was obtained using the BJH method applied to the isotherm desorption branch 100. The real amount of copper and gold in the promoted catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100 (Waltham, MA, USA). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment; each sample (50 mg) was heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mLmin -1 STP).The effluent gases were analysed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector (Bethlehem, PA, USA) using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-NIR spectra were collected at r.t. on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 powder as an internal reference, working in the 50,000-4000 cm -1 range.UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the as prepared samples are reported in the Kubelka reflectance of an \"infinitely thick\" layer of the sample 101.The layer of powder sample was made sufficiently thick such that all incident light was absorbed or scattered before reaching the back surface of the sample holder.Typically, a thickness of 1-3 mm was required. The samples in the form of powders were placed in a quartz cell, allowing treatments in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The band gap energy (Eg) of the catalysts was determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge, and it can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/) and photon energy (Eg 1240/). The FTIR analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2000 spectrometer (equipped with a cryogenic MCT detector) (Waltham, MA, USA).As for the analyses at increasing temperature, each sample, in the form of self-supporting pellet, was placed in an AABSPEC 2000 cell allowing to run the spectra in situ in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The samples were outgassed from room temperature up to 150 C. As for the measurements of CO 2 adsorption at room temperature, the samples were submitted to outgassing at r.t. for 1 h in order to remove water, that is, adsorbed at the surface due to the exposition to air.The spectrum of the sample before the inlet of CO 2 was subtracted from each spectrum, and all spectra were normalised with respect to the density of the pellets. The catalytic apparatus was reported in a previous work 16; however, in this paper two new experimental setups, such as the reactor geometry and the catalyst introduction, were used.In the former case a tubular borate glass fixed bed reactor (length 40 mm, diameter 4 mm) was exploited.The catalyst (400 mg) was introduced as small particles with size 0.2-0.3mm.In the latter case, the CO 2 photoreduction was performed using a borate glass thin film reactor (length 33 mm, height 18 mm, thickness 2 mm).Here, the catalyst (10 mg) was inserted by depositing the catalyst suspended in 2-propanol on the light-exposed side of the reactor.2-propanol can act as a hydrogen donor leading to data misinterpretation.To overcome this problem, drying at 110 C for 1 h was sufficient to eliminate all residues of CO 2 photoreduction. The samples were illuminated using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l (Cambiago, Italy).with emission range 315-400 shielded by a special tubular quartz, to select the 366 nm wavelength), with an average irradiance of 50 Wm -2 .It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it; thus, it is possible to state that the reactor walls do not adsorb the light.In performed tests, neither heating nor cooling is used.UV lamp provides a stable and constant temperature of 40 C on the photocatalytic surface.Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).The reactor was closed when the system reached the equilibrium state, and this point was taken as the beginning of the reaction.Therefore, the reaction was not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it took place in static conditions.A total of 9.2 mol of CO 2 and 0.7 mol of H 2 O were present within the sealed reactor.In all catalytic tests, the reaction time was 6 h. The reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in molg cat -1 , as commonly used in literature 102,103, with an average error of 10.Quantum yield () was calculated according to IUPAC recommendations 104, as reported in Equations ( 1) and (2). () required e -CH 4 (mol) incident photons (mol) 100 ( 1) where 8 is the number of required electrons for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , Irr is the irradiance, t is reaction time, A is the illuminated area, radiation wavelength, N A is Avogadro's number, h is Planck's constant, and c is speed of light. The development of an efficient technology for carbon dioxide conversion into solar fuel relies on an integrated and interdisciplinary \"catalysis by design\" approach covering different expertise areas, such as fundamental science and applied engineering.In this paper, two main carbon dioxide photoreduction drawbacks, namely light harvesting and process selectivity, were investigated. Light harvesting was enormously implemented by reactor design; the choice of a thin film reactor enhanced methane enormously, leading to comparable results with those found in literature, despite considerably milder conditions, particularly in terms of irradiance. On the contrary, the material design was fundamental to developing an opportunely designed catalytic system to control the selectivity to the desired product, i.e., methane.Modification of electronic and surface properties allowed us to reach this goal.On one side, the enhanced charge separation observed for Au-TiO 2 seems to negatively affect the activity, resulting in a less negative CB, thus less efficient in CO 2 photoreduction. On the other side, CO 2 adsorption on the catalytic surface represents a critical step that still deserves as much attention as developing greener and highly active catalysts.The CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst matches all these requirements, proving to be more active and selective than the Au-TiO 2 material.The reasons for the enhanced photoactivity could be related to the presence and the abundance of surface sites able to efficiently adsorb and react with the CO 2 reactant.

The precipitation method has been chosen to synthesise the titania samples.A 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M NaOH solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep a neutral pH.Then the Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered and washed with distilled water to remove the sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of the barium chloride test 96.The obtained wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow to obtain TiO 2 .This sample has been labelled as TiO 2 . According to a previous work 16, the introduction of copper oxide into titania provides the highest effect on the photoactivity when the Cu amount is 0.2 wt..In particular, incipient wetness impregnation with a copper precursor, namely Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O, has been performed on dried Ti(OH) 4 .Then, the copper-impregnated sample has been calcined at 400 C in air flow in order to obtain the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst. In this case, the incipient wetness method would not allow us to deposit small gold nanoparticles on the titania surface 97.Therefore, in order to obtain small gold nanoparticles, gold has been added to titania by using the deposition-precipitation (DP) method, thus maintaining the pH equal to 8.6 98.Titanium dioxide has been suspended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 3H 2 O for 3 h, while controlling the pH value by the addition of NaOH (0.5 M).The Au amount was 0.2 wt., the same as in the case of the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst, for comparison purposes.After filtration, the samples have been washed with distilled water to remove chlorides.The absence of chlorides was verified by the silver nitrate test.The samples have been dried at 35 C overnight and finally calcined in air for 1 h at 400 C. The final sample has been labelled Au-TiO 2 . The thermal analyses (TG/DTA) have been performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG Instrument (Bavaria, Germany) in air flux (20 mL/min) using a 10 C/min temperature rate between 25-800 C. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns have been collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) (Billerica, MA, USA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu K radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving, and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm, respectively.Data scans have been performed in the 2 range 5-75 with 0.02 step size and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination have been performed using the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS, Billerica, MA, USA) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of the crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 196 C were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyser (Norcross, GA, USA) to obtain information on the surface properties.All samples were previously outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.The mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.The surface area was evaluated using the standard BET 99 equation, and the pore size distribution was obtained using the BJH method applied to the isotherm desorption branch 100. The real amount of copper and gold in the promoted catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100 (Waltham, MA, USA). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment; each sample (50 mg) was heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mLmin -1 STP).The effluent gases were analysed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector (Bethlehem, PA, USA) using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-NIR spectra were collected at r.t. on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 powder as an internal reference, working in the 50,000-4000 cm -1 range.UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the as prepared samples are reported in the Kubelka reflectance of an \"infinitely thick\" layer of the sample 101.The layer of powder sample was made sufficiently thick such that all incident light was absorbed or scattered before reaching the back surface of the sample holder.Typically, a thickness of 1-3 mm was required. The samples in the form of powders were placed in a quartz cell, allowing treatments in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The band gap energy (Eg) of the catalysts was determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge, and it can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/) and photon energy (Eg 1240/). The FTIR analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2000 spectrometer (equipped with a cryogenic MCT detector) (Waltham, MA, USA).As for the analyses at increasing temperature, each sample, in the form of self-supporting pellet, was placed in an AABSPEC 2000 cell allowing to run the spectra in situ in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The samples were outgassed from room temperature up to 150 C.

The samples were illuminated using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l (Cambiago, Italy).with emission range 315-400 shielded by a special tubular quartz, to select the 366 nm wavelength), with an average irradiance of 50 Wm -2 .It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it; thus, it is possible to state that the reactor walls do not adsorb the light.In performed tests, neither heating nor cooling is used.UV lamp provides a stable and constant temperature of 40 C on the photocatalytic surface.Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).The reactor was closed when the system reached the equilibrium state, and this point was taken as the beginning of the reaction.Therefore, the reaction was not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it took place in static conditions.A total of 9.2 mol of CO 2 and 0.7 mol of H 2 O were present within the sealed reactor.In all catalytic tests, the reaction time was 6 h.

The real amount of copper and gold in the promoted catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100 (Waltham, MA, USA). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment; each sample (50 mg) was heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mLmin -1 STP).The effluent gases were analysed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector (Bethlehem, PA, USA) using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-NIR spectra were collected at r.t. on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 powder as an internal reference, working in the 50,000-4000 cm -1 range.UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the as prepared samples are reported in the Kubelka reflectance of an \"infinitely thick\" layer of the sample 101.The layer of powder sample was made sufficiently thick such that all incident light was absorbed or scattered before reaching the back surface of the sample holder.Typically, a thickness of 1-3 mm was required. The samples in the form of powders were placed in a quartz cell, allowing treatments in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The band gap energy (Eg) of the catalysts was determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge, and it can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/) and photon energy (Eg 1240/). The FTIR analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2000 spectrometer (equipped with a cryogenic MCT detector) (Waltham, MA, USA).As for the analyses at increasing temperature, each sample, in the form of self-supporting pellet, was placed in an AABSPEC 2000 cell allowing to run the spectra in situ in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The samples were outgassed from room temperature up to 150 C. As for the measurements of CO 2 adsorption at room temperature, the samples were submitted to outgassing at r.t. for 1 h in order to remove water, that is, adsorbed at the surface due to the exposition to air.The spectrum of the sample before the inlet of CO 2 was subtracted from each spectrum, and all spectra were normalised with respect to the density of the pellets. The catalytic apparatus was reported in a previous work 16; however, in this paper two new experimental setups, such as the reactor geometry and the catalyst introduction, were used.In the former case a tubular borate glass fixed bed reactor (length 40 mm, diameter 4 mm) was exploited.The catalyst (400 mg) was introduced as small particles with size 0.2-0.3mm.In the latter case, the CO 2 photoreduction was performed using a borate glass thin film reactor (length 33 mm, height 18 mm, thickness 2 mm).Here, the catalyst (10 mg) was inserted by depositing the catalyst suspended in 2-propanol on the light-exposed side of the reactor.2-propanol can act as a hydrogen donor leading to data misinterpretation.To overcome this problem, drying at 110 C for 1 h was sufficient to eliminate all residues of CO 2 photoreduction. The samples were illuminated using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l (Cambiago, Italy).with emission range 315-400 shielded by a special tubular quartz, to select the 366 nm wavelength), with an average irradiance of 50 Wm -2 .It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it; thus, it is possible to state that the reactor walls do not adsorb the light.In performed tests, neither heating nor cooling is used.UV lamp provides a stable and constant temperature of 40 C on the photocatalytic surface.Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).The reactor was closed when the system reached the equilibrium state, and this point was taken as the beginning of the reaction.Therefore, the reaction was not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it took place in static conditions.A total of 9.2 mol of CO 2 and 0.7 mol of H 2 O were present within the sealed reactor.In all catalytic tests, the reaction time was 6 h. The reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in molg cat -1 , as commonly used in literature 102,103, with an average error of 10.Quantum yield () was calculated according to IUPAC recommendations 104, as reported in Equations ( 1) and (2). () required e -CH 4 (mol) incident photons (mol) 100 ( 1) where 8 is the number of required electrons for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , Irr is the irradiance, t is reaction time, A is the illuminated area, radiation wavelength, N A is Avogadro's number, h is Planck's constant, and c is speed of light. The development of an efficient technology for carbon dioxide conversion into solar fuel relies on an integrated and interdisciplinary \"catalysis by design\" approach covering different expertise areas, such as fundamental science and applied engineering.In this paper, two main carbon dioxide photoreduction drawbacks, namely light harvesting and process selectivity, were investigated. Light harvesting was enormously implemented by reactor design; the choice of a thin film reactor enhanced methane enormously, leading to comparable results with those found in literature, despite considerably milder conditions, particularly in terms of irradiance. On the contrary, the material design was fundamental to developing an opportunely designed catalytic system to control the selectivity to the desired product, i.e., methane.Modification of electronic and surface properties allowed us to reach this goal.On one side, the enhanced charge separation observed for Au-TiO 2 seems to negatively affect the activity, resulting in a less negative CB, thus less efficient in CO 2 photoreduction. On the other side, CO 2 adsorption on the catalytic surface represents a critical step that still deserves as much attention as developing greener and highly active catalysts.The CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst matches all these requirements, proving to be more active and selective than the Au-TiO 2 material.The reasons for the enhanced photoactivity could be related to the presence and the abundance of surface sites able to efficiently adsorb and react with the CO 2 reactant.

The precipitation method has been chosen to synthesise the titania samples.A 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M NaOH solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep a neutral pH.Then the Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered and washed with distilled water to remove the sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of the barium chloride test 96.The obtained wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow to obtain TiO 2 .This sample has been labelled as TiO 2 . According to a previous work 16, the introduction of copper oxide into titania provides the highest effect on the photoactivity when the Cu amount is 0.2 wt..In particular, incipient wetness impregnation with a copper precursor, namely Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O, has been performed on dried Ti(OH) 4 .Then, the copper-impregnated sample has been calcined at 400 C in air flow in order to obtain the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst. In this case, the incipient wetness method would not allow us to deposit small gold nanoparticles on the titania surface 97.Therefore, in order to obtain small gold nanoparticles, gold has been added to titania by using the deposition-precipitation (DP) method, thus maintaining the pH equal to 8.6 98.Titanium dioxide has been suspended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 3H 2 O for 3 h, while controlling the pH value by the addition of NaOH (0.5 M).The Au amount was 0.2 wt., the same as in the case of the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst, for comparison purposes.After filtration, the samples have been washed with distilled water to remove chlorides.The absence of chlorides was verified by the silver nitrate test.The samples have been dried at 35 C overnight and finally calcined in air for 1 h at 400 C. The final sample has been labelled Au-TiO 2 . The thermal analyses (TG/DTA) have been performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG Instrument (Bavaria, Germany) in air flux (20 mL/min) using a 10 C/min temperature rate between 25-800 C. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns have been collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) (Billerica, MA, USA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu K radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving, and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm, respectively.Data scans have been performed in the 2 range 5-75 with 0.02 step size and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination have been performed using the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS, Billerica, MA, USA) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of the crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 196 C were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyser (Norcross, GA, USA) to obtain information on the surface properties.All samples were previously outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.The mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.The surface area was evaluated using the standard BET 99 equation, and the pore size distribution was obtained using the BJH method applied to the isotherm desorption branch 100. The real amount of copper and gold in the promoted catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100 (Waltham, MA, USA).

According to a previous work 16, the introduction of copper oxide into titania provides the highest effect on the photoactivity when the Cu amount is 0.2 wt..In particular, incipient wetness impregnation with a copper precursor, namely Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O, has been performed on dried Ti(OH) 4 .Then, the copper-impregnated sample has been calcined at 400 C in air flow in order to obtain the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst. In this case, the incipient wetness method would not allow us to deposit small gold nanoparticles on the titania surface 97.Therefore, in order to obtain small gold nanoparticles, gold has been added to titania by using the deposition-precipitation (DP) method, thus maintaining the pH equal to 8.6 98.Titanium dioxide has been suspended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 3H 2 O for 3 h, while controlling the pH value by the addition of NaOH (0.5 M).The Au amount was 0.2 wt., the same as in the case of the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst, for comparison purposes.After filtration, the samples have been washed with distilled water to remove chlorides.The absence of chlorides was verified by the silver nitrate test.The samples have been dried at 35 C overnight and finally calcined in air for 1 h at 400 C. The final sample has been labelled Au-TiO 2 . The thermal analyses (TG/DTA) have been performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG Instrument (Bavaria, Germany) in air flux (20 mL/min) using a 10 C/min temperature rate between 25-800 C. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns have been collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) (Billerica, MA, USA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu K radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving, and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm, respectively.Data scans have been performed in the 2 range 5-75 with 0.02 step size and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination have been performed using the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS, Billerica, MA, USA) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of the crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 196 C were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyser (Norcross, GA, USA) to obtain information on the surface properties.All samples were previously outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.The mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.The surface area was evaluated using the standard BET 99 equation, and the pore size distribution was obtained using the BJH method applied to the isotherm desorption branch 100. The real amount of copper and gold in the promoted catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100 (Waltham, MA, USA). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment; each sample (50 mg) was heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mLmin -1 STP).The effluent gases were analysed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector (Bethlehem, PA, USA) using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-NIR spectra were collected at r.t. on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 powder as an internal reference, working in the 50,000-4000 cm -1 range.UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the as prepared samples are reported in the Kubelka reflectance of an \"infinitely thick\" layer of the sample 101.The layer of powder sample was made sufficiently thick such that all incident light was absorbed or scattered before reaching the back surface of the sample holder.Typically, a thickness of 1-3 mm was required. The samples in the form of powders were placed in a quartz cell, allowing treatments in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The band gap energy (Eg) of the catalysts was determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge, and it can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/) and photon energy (Eg 1240/). The FTIR analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2000 spectrometer (equipped with a cryogenic MCT detector) (Waltham, MA, USA).As for the analyses at increasing temperature, each sample, in the form of self-supporting pellet, was placed in an AABSPEC 2000 cell allowing to run the spectra in situ in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The samples were outgassed from room temperature up to 150 C. As for the measurements of CO 2 adsorption at room temperature, the samples were submitted to outgassing at r.t. for 1 h in order to remove water, that is, adsorbed at the surface due to the exposition to air.The spectrum of the sample before the inlet of CO 2 was subtracted from each spectrum, and all spectra were normalised with respect to the density of the pellets. The catalytic apparatus was reported in a previous work 16; however, in this paper two new experimental setups, such as the reactor geometry and the catalyst introduction, were used.In the former case a tubular borate glass fixed bed reactor (length 40 mm, diameter 4 mm) was exploited.The catalyst (400 mg) was introduced as small particles with size 0.2-0.3mm.In the latter case, the CO 2 photoreduction was performed using a borate glass thin film reactor (length 33 mm, height 18 mm, thickness 2 mm).Here, the catalyst (10 mg) was inserted by depositing the catalyst suspended in 2-propanol on the light-exposed side of the reactor.2-propanol can act as a hydrogen donor leading to data misinterpretation.To overcome this problem, drying at 110 C for 1 h was sufficient to eliminate all residues of CO 2 photoreduction. The samples were illuminated using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l (Cambiago, Italy).with emission range 315-400 shielded by a special tubular quartz, to select the 366 nm wavelength), with an average irradiance of 50 Wm -2 .It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it; thus, it is possible to state that the reactor walls do not adsorb the light.In performed tests, neither heating nor cooling is used.UV lamp provides a stable and constant temperature of 40 C on the photocatalytic surface.Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).The reactor was closed when the system reached the equilibrium state, and this point was taken as the beginning of the reaction.Therefore, the reaction was not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it took place in static conditions.A total of 9.2 mol of CO 2 and 0.7 mol of H 2 O were present within the sealed reactor.In all catalytic tests, the reaction time was 6 h. The reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in molg cat -1 , as commonly used in literature 102,103, with an average error of 10.Quantum yield () was calculated according to IUPAC recommendations 104, as reported in Equations ( 1) and (2). () required e -CH 4 (mol) incident photons (mol) 100 ( 1) where 8 is the number of required electrons for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , Irr is the irradiance, t is reaction time, A is the illuminated area, radiation wavelength, N A is Avogadro's number, h is Planck's constant, and c is speed of light. The development of an efficient technology for carbon dioxide conversion into solar fuel relies on an integrated and interdisciplinary \"catalysis by design\" approach covering different expertise areas, such as fundamental science and applied engineering.In this paper, two main carbon dioxide photoreduction drawbacks, namely light harvesting and process selectivity, were investigated. Light harvesting was enormously implemented by reactor design; the choice of a thin film reactor enhanced methane enormously, leading to comparable results with those found in literature, despite considerably milder conditions, particularly in terms of irradiance. On the contrary, the material design was fundamental to developing an opportunely designed catalytic system to control the selectivity to the desired product, i.e., methane.Modification of electronic and surface properties allowed us to reach this goal.On one side, the enhanced charge separation observed for Au-TiO 2 seems to negatively affect the activity, resulting in a less negative CB, thus less efficient in CO 2 photoreduction. On the other side, CO 2 adsorption on the catalytic surface represents a critical step that still deserves as much attention as developing greener and highly active catalysts.The CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst matches all these requirements, proving to be more active and selective than the Au-TiO 2 material.The reasons for the enhanced photoactivity could be related to the presence and the abundance of surface sites able to efficiently adsorb and react with the CO 2 reactant.

The precipitation method has been chosen to synthesise the titania samples.A 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M NaOH solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep a neutral pH.Then the Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered and washed with distilled water to remove the sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of the barium chloride test 96.The obtained wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow to obtain TiO 2 .This sample has been labelled as TiO 2 . According to a previous work 16, the introduction of copper oxide into titania provides the highest effect on the photoactivity when the Cu amount is 0.2 wt..In particular, incipient wetness impregnation with a copper precursor, namely Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O, has been performed on dried Ti(OH) 4 .Then, the copper-impregnated sample has been calcined at 400 C in air flow in order to obtain the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst. In this case, the incipient wetness method would not allow us to deposit small gold nanoparticles on the titania surface 97.Therefore, in order to obtain small gold nanoparticles, gold has been added to titania by using the deposition-precipitation (DP) method, thus maintaining the pH equal to 8.6 98.Titanium dioxide has been suspended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 3H 2 O for 3 h, while controlling the pH value by the addition of NaOH (0.5 M).The Au amount was 0.2 wt., the same as in the case of the CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst, for comparison purposes.After filtration, the samples have been washed with distilled water to remove chlorides.The absence of chlorides was verified by the silver nitrate test.The samples have been dried at 35 C overnight and finally calcined in air for 1 h at 400 C. The final sample has been labelled Au-TiO 2 . The thermal analyses (TG/DTA) have been performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG Instrument (Bavaria, Germany) in air flux (20 mL/min) using a 10 C/min temperature rate between 25-800 C. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns have been collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) (Billerica, MA, USA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu K radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving, and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm, respectively.Data scans have been performed in the 2 range 5-75 with 0.02 step size and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination have been performed using the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS, Billerica, MA, USA) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of the crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 196 C were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyser (Norcross, GA, USA) to obtain information on the surface properties.All samples were previously outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.The mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.The surface area was evaluated using the standard BET 99 equation, and the pore size distribution was obtained using the BJH method applied to the isotherm desorption branch 100. The real amount of copper and gold in the promoted catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100 (Waltham, MA, USA). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment; each sample (50 mg) was heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mLmin -1 STP).The effluent gases were analysed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector (Bethlehem, PA, USA) using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-NIR spectra were collected at r.t. on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 powder as an internal reference, working in the 50,000-4000 cm -1 range.UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the as prepared samples are reported in the Kubelka reflectance of an \"infinitely thick\" layer of the sample 101.The layer of powder sample was made sufficiently thick such that all incident light was absorbed or scattered before reaching the back surface of the sample holder.Typically, a thickness of 1-3 mm was required. The samples in the form of powders were placed in a quartz cell, allowing treatments in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The band gap energy (Eg) of the catalysts was determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge, and it can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/) and photon energy (Eg 1240/). The FTIR analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2000 spectrometer (equipped with a cryogenic MCT detector) (Waltham, MA, USA).As for the analyses at increasing temperature, each sample, in the form of self-supporting pellet, was placed in an AABSPEC 2000 cell allowing to run the spectra in situ in controlled atmosphere and temperature.The samples were outgassed from room temperature up to 150 C. As for the measurements of CO 2 adsorption at room temperature, the samples were submitted to outgassing at r.t. for 1 h in order to remove water, that is, adsorbed at the surface due to the exposition to air.The spectrum of the sample before the inlet of CO 2 was subtracted from each spectrum, and all spectra were normalised with respect to the density of the pellets. The catalytic apparatus was reported in a previous work 16; however, in this paper two new experimental setups, such as the reactor geometry and the catalyst introduction, were used.In the former case a tubular borate glass fixed bed reactor (length 40 mm, diameter 4 mm) was exploited.The catalyst (400 mg) was introduced as small particles with size 0.2-0.3mm.In the latter case, the CO 2 photoreduction was performed using a borate glass thin film reactor (length 33 mm, height 18 mm, thickness 2 mm).Here, the catalyst (10 mg) was inserted by depositing the catalyst suspended in 2-propanol on the light-exposed side of the reactor.2-propanol can act as a hydrogen donor leading to data misinterpretation.To overcome this problem, drying at 110 C for 1 h was sufficient to eliminate all residues of CO 2 photoreduction. The samples were illuminated using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l (Cambiago, Italy).with emission range 315-400 shielded by a special tubular quartz, to select the 366 nm wavelength), with an average irradiance of 50 Wm -2 .It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it; thus, it is possible to state that the reactor walls do not adsorb the light.In performed tests, neither heating nor cooling is used.UV lamp provides a stable and constant temperature of 40 C on the photocatalytic surface.Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).The reactor was closed when the system reached the equilibrium state, and this point was taken as the beginning of the reaction.Therefore, the reaction was not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it took place in static conditions.A total of 9.2 mol of CO 2 and 0.7 mol of H 2 O were present within the sealed reactor.In all catalytic tests, the reaction time was 6 h. The reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in molg cat -1 , as commonly used in literature 102,103, with an average error of 10.Quantum yield () was calculated according to IUPAC recommendations 104, as reported in Equations ( 1) and (2).

The development of an efficient technology for carbon dioxide conversion into solar fuel relies on an integrated and interdisciplinary \"catalysis by design\" approach covering different expertise areas, such as fundamental science and applied engineering.In this paper, two main carbon dioxide photoreduction drawbacks, namely light harvesting and process selectivity, were investigated. Light harvesting was enormously implemented by reactor design; the choice of a thin film reactor enhanced methane enormously, leading to comparable results with those found in literature, despite considerably milder conditions, particularly in terms of irradiance. On the contrary, the material design was fundamental to developing an opportunely designed catalytic system to control the selectivity to the desired product, i.e., methane.Modification of electronic and surface properties allowed us to reach this goal.On one side, the enhanced charge separation observed for Au-TiO 2 seems to negatively affect the activity, resulting in a less negative CB, thus less efficient in CO 2 photoreduction. On the other side, CO 2 adsorption on the catalytic surface represents a critical step that still deserves as much attention as developing greener and highly active catalysts.The CuO-TiO 2 photocatalyst matches all these requirements, proving to be more active and selective than the Au-TiO 2 material.The reasons for the enhanced photoactivity could be related to the presence and the abundance of surface sites able to efficiently adsorb and react with the CO 2 reactant.
