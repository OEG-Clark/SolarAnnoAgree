This was attributed to the fact that MgAl-LDO contains much more strong Lewis basic sits for CO 2 adsorption to produce m-CO 3 2A and the Lewis acid sites for the dissociation of H 2 O into H and OH groups.Moreover, photoluminescence spectra further indicated that oxygen vacancy existed in the interface of MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 , which facilitated the photogenerated charges separation and also contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic performance.As a result, the Lewis acidic-basic characteristics of MgAl-LDO, as well as the improved charges separation, should be responsible for the increased photocatalytic activity of Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 toward CO 2 reduction.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "TiO 2 nanorods were prepared by a modified hydrothermal method.", "context": "TiO 2 nanorods were prepared by a modified hydrothermal method.Typically, 6 mL HCl was dropped into 15 mL titanium isopropoxide in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at room temperature, and then the mixture was sealed and kept at 180 C for 36 h.After being cooled to room temperature, the resulting white precipitates were filtered out and washed with diluent NaOH solution followed by water until the filtrate became neutral.The products were finally dried overnight in vacuum at 80 C.

Scheme 2. A possible reaction pathway for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 . 505152lated to decrease the energy barrier for CO 2 reduction505152.The enhanced CO 2 reduction on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 photocatalyst could be explained by considering the larger number of Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites in MgAl-LDO, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in the CO 2 reduction process.A new peak appeared at 2922 cm A1 assigned to vibration of C-H, which may be generated from the product of CH 4 via a multistep reduction.Moreover, the peak intensity of OH groups was obviously decreased, suggesting that H 2 O oxidation reaction occurred.Unfortunately, the characteristic FTIR peaks for other possible intermediates, such as CO, HCOOH, CH 2 O and CH 3 OH, were not distinguished, which might be owing to the low amount without the detection limit of FTIR instrumentation.Based on the above results, a possible route for the conversion of surface m-CO 3 2A to CO 2 A species in the presence of H 2 O are proposed (Scheme 2), that is, the adsorbed H 2 O molecule was dissociated to form surface OH A and H , followed by m-CO 3 2A species coordinated with the dissociated H to form the active reaction intermediate of m-HCO 3 A .As the CAO bond of m-HCO 3 A could be weaken via hydrogen bonding interaction, CAO bond would be easily cleaved to form CO 2 A species with the assistance of photogenerated electrons.Also, a mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 was proposed, as shown in Scheme 3. TiO 2 adsorbs light to generate electron-hole pairs, which are then separated to be electrons and holes.The electrons transfer through MgAl-LDO layer by tunneling effect to Pt cocatalysts and participate in CO 2 reduction reaction.Meanwhile, CO 2 is chemisorbed on MgAl-LDO layered TiO 2 to form m-A species.The chemisorbed CO 2 A is mainly reduced to be adsorbed CO via one-electron transfer process.Adsorbed CO subsequently is desorbed to produce CO or further reduced and protonated by electrons and atomic H from H 2 O with a successive electron-transfer process to generate CH 4 .On other hand, the holes in the valence band is trapped by water to generate O 2 .

This was attributed to the fact that MgAl-LDO contains much more strong Lewis basic sits for CO 2 adsorption to produce m-CO 3 2A and the Lewis acid sites for the dissociation of H 2 O into H and OH groups.Moreover, photoluminescence spectra further indicated that oxygen vacancy existed in the interface of MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 , which facilitated the photogenerated charges separation and also contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic performance.As a result, the Lewis acidic-basic characteristics of MgAl-LDO, as well as the improved charges separation, should be responsible for the increased photocatalytic activity of Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 toward CO 2 reduction.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Pt", "source": "Cocatalysts of 1 wtPt were loaded on TiO 2 -based samples by an in-situ photodeposition method, using H 2 PtCl 6 A6H 2 O as precursors.", "context": "TiO 2 nanorods were prepared by a modified hydrothermal method.Typically, 6 mL HCl was dropped into 15 mL titanium isopropoxide in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at room temperature, and then the mixture was sealed and kept at 180 C for 36 h.After being cooled to room temperature, the resulting white precipitates were filtered out and washed with diluent NaOH solution followed by water until the filtrate became neutral.The products were finally dried overnight in vacuum at 80 C.

The crystalline phases were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (operating voltage: 40 kV, operating current: 20 mA, scan rate: 5/min).UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded on a UV-vis 2600 spectrophotometer (SHIMADZA) and calibrated with Kubelka-Munk method.The morphology was examined by a JSM-7610F scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.Elemental analysis was collected by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, OXFORD X-act) on the SEM (accelerating voltage: 20 kV, probe current: 0.02 mA, Time: 300 s).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed on a JEOL JEM-2010 TEM (Japan) with the accelerating voltage of 200 kV.The contents of metal elements were determined by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Optima DV2100, PerkinElmer, USA).Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were carried out on a FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh, excitation source, 450 W Xe lamp; excitation wavelength, 350 nm).Specific surface area was analyzed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 77 K using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer in 4000-400 cm A1 using pressed KBr pellet method. The infrared spectra of CO 2 adsorption were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm A1 using 16 scans on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet NEXUS 470) with a MCT detector.The experiments were carried out using a special IR cell in conjunction with a vacuum system.Typically, 20 mg of catalyst was first pressed into a self-supporting thin wafer (15 mm diameter) and then was transferred to the sample holder in the special IR cell.The wafer was evacuated at 350 C for 2 h to remove the adsorbed molecules, and then cooled down to room temperature for recording the background spectrum of the sample.CO 2 was introduced to the cell and followed by degassing before recording the IR spectrum of adsorbed CO 2 .The pretreatment of sample for IR spectra with pyridine adsorption was similar to that of IR for CO 2 adsorption.Typically, 20 mg of the sample was evacuated at 350 C for 1 h to remove the impurities in the cell, and then the background spectrum of the sample was recorded.After introducing the pyridine vapor for 15 min followed by being degassed under vacuum at 150 C for 30 min, the spectrum was recorded. In-situ IR spectra for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O before and after UV irradiation were recorded with a Nicolet (NEXUS 470) spectrophotometer in the range 4000-1000 cm A1 with a resolution of 4 cm A1 .The pretreatment of sample was identical to IR of CO 2 adsorption.The wafer was evacuated at 350 C for 1 h to remove the adsorbed molecules, and then was cooled down to room temperature for recording the background spectrum.Subsequently, CO 2 and H 2 O were introduced to IR cell at room temperature and followed by degassing for 1 h and subsequently under UV irradiation for 1 h at room temperature to record the corresponding spectra.Spectra of the adsorbed species were obtained by subtracting the catalyst spectrum. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was carried out using gas-solid mode in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system.The light source was a topirradiated 300 W Xe lamp (LS-SXE300 CUV, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd).Typically, 20 mg of catalyst was evenly dis-persed onto a glass-sheet (1.5 cm A 2 cm), and then was placed on the holder in the upper region of the reactor, in which 40 mL water was charged on the bottom in advance.The light intensity at the location of catalyst was 4.3 mW cm A2 for 260-400 nm measured by an UV irradiatometer with a Si photodiode (Shenzhen Linshang).The reactor was sealed and degassed for 30 min, and then CO 2 was bubbled slowly till the pressure up to 1 atm.Finally, the reaction was conducted under light irradiation at 20 C for 8 h.The generated CO and CH 4 , as well as H 2 and O 2 , were determined by an on-line GC 7900 gas chromatograph (Shanghai Tianmei) equipped with methanator, flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and the relative standard deviations for the amounts of H 2 , CO and CH 4 formed were 5.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Pt", "source": "Conditions: photocatalyst, 0.02 g; co-catalyst, 1 wt Pt; CO 2 pressure: 1 atm; light source, 300 W xenon lamp; reaction temperature, 20 C; and, reaction time, 8 h.", "context": "In summary, we have demonstrated a facile process to fabricate MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 with abundant Lewis basic and acidic sites, which exhibited significant enhancement toward the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.The in-situ FTIR analysis on CO 2 and/or H 2 O adsorption and the photoreduction process revealed the predominant carbonate species were m-CO 3 2A and m-HCO 3 A on MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 .Unlike b-CO 3 , m-CO 3 2A species could be readily converted to active m-HCO 3 A and then transformed to surface CO 2 , which ultimately was reduced to the products of CO and/or CH 4 in the presence of H 2 O under UV irradiation.Moreover, the photogenerated charge separation efficiency was obviously enhanced in MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 , as evidenced by PL spectra.The essential roles of MgAl-LDO were attributed to the enhanced adsorption of CO 2 and the ease adsorption/dissociation of H 2 O (decrease the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step CO 2 /CO 2 A ), as well as the increased oxygen vacancy (promote the photogener-ated charge separation) in MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 , consequently enhanced the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency.This work, for the first time, demonstrates MgAl-LDO possesses Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of H 2 O.It is believed that the interface engineering of semiconductor and cocatalyst with the compounds containing Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites would significantly enhance the CO 2 reduction efficiency, which should be received great interests in future.

Scheme 2. A possible reaction pathway for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 . 505152lated to decrease the energy barrier for CO 2 reduction505152.The enhanced CO 2 reduction on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 photocatalyst could be explained by considering the larger number of Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites in MgAl-LDO, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in the CO 2 reduction process.A new peak appeared at 2922 cm A1 assigned to vibration of C-H, which may be generated from the product of CH 4 via a multistep reduction.Moreover, the peak intensity of OH groups was obviously decreased, suggesting that H 2 O oxidation reaction occurred.Unfortunately, the characteristic FTIR peaks for other possible intermediates, such as CO, HCOOH, CH 2 O and CH 3 OH, were not distinguished, which might be owing to the low amount without the detection limit of FTIR instrumentation.Based on the above results, a possible route for the conversion of surface m-CO 3 2A to CO 2 A species in the presence of H 2 O are proposed (Scheme 2), that is, the adsorbed H 2 O molecule was dissociated to form surface OH A and H , followed by m-CO 3 2A species coordinated with the dissociated H to form the active reaction intermediate of m-HCO 3 A .As the CAO bond of m-HCO 3 A could be weaken via hydrogen bonding interaction, CAO bond would be easily cleaved to form CO 2 A species with the assistance of photogenerated electrons.Also, a mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 was proposed, as shown in Scheme 3. TiO 2 adsorbs light to generate electron-hole pairs, which are then separated to be electrons and holes.The electrons transfer through MgAl-LDO layer by tunneling effect to Pt cocatalysts and participate in CO 2 reduction reaction.Meanwhile, CO 2 is chemisorbed on MgAl-LDO layered TiO 2 to form m-A species.The chemisorbed CO 2 A is mainly reduced to be adsorbed CO via one-electron transfer process.Adsorbed CO subsequently is desorbed to produce CO or further reduced and protonated by electrons and atomic H from H 2 O with a successive electron-transfer process to generate CH 4 .On other hand, the holes in the valence band is trapped by water to generate O 2 .

This was attributed to the fact that MgAl-LDO contains much more strong Lewis basic sits for CO 2 adsorption to produce m-CO 3 2A and the Lewis acid sites for the dissociation of H 2 O into H and OH groups.Moreover, photoluminescence spectra further indicated that oxygen vacancy existed in the interface of MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 , which facilitated the photogenerated charges separation and also contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic performance.As a result, the Lewis acidic-basic characteristics of MgAl-LDO, as well as the improved charges separation, should be responsible for the increased photocatalytic activity of Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 toward CO 2 reduction.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Typically, 60 mL aqueous solution containing Mg(NO 3 ) 2 A6H 2 O and Al(NO 3 ) 3 A9H 2 O (Mg 2 Al 3 0.5 mol L A1 , Mg/Al 3:1) was added dropwise into 100 mL glycine (0.5 mol L A1 ) under continuous Ar flow.", "context": "TiO 2 nanorods were prepared by a modified hydrothermal method.Typically, 6 mL HCl was dropped into 15 mL titanium isopropoxide in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at room temperature, and then the mixture was sealed and kept at 180 C for 36 h.After being cooled to room temperature, the resulting white precipitates were filtered out and washed with diluent NaOH solution followed by water until the filtrate became neutral.The products were finally dried overnight in vacuum at 80 C.

A species in the presence of H 2 O.A possible reason for these differences might be attributed to the dissociation of adsorbed H 2 O (H 2 O !H OH A ) on the surface Lewis acid sites (coordinately unsaturated Al 3 ) and thus formed Al-OH group, and then m-CO 3 2A Illustration of the mechanism toward the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor. 3 2A distinctly decreased, indicating m-CO 3 2A species might participate in Scheme 3. Scheme 2. A possible reaction pathway for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 . 505152lated to decrease the energy barrier for CO 2 reduction505152.The enhanced CO 2 reduction on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 photocatalyst could be explained by considering the larger number of Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites in MgAl-LDO, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in the CO 2 reduction process.A new peak appeared at 2922 cm A1 assigned to vibration of C-H, which may be generated from the product of CH 4 via a multistep reduction.Moreover, the peak intensity of OH groups was obviously decreased, suggesting that H 2 O oxidation reaction occurred.Unfortunately, the characteristic FTIR peaks for other possible intermediates, such as CO, HCOOH, CH 2 O and CH 3 OH, were not distinguished, which might be owing to the low amount without the detection limit of FTIR instrumentation.Based on the above results, a possible route for the conversion of surface m-CO 3 2A to CO 2 A species in the presence of H 2 O are proposed (Scheme 2), that is, the adsorbed H 2 O molecule was dissociated to form surface OH A and H , followed by m-CO 3 2A species coordinated with the dissociated H to form the active reaction intermediate of m-HCO 3 A .As the CAO bond of m-HCO 3 A could be weaken via hydrogen bonding interaction, CAO bond would be easily cleaved to form CO 2 A species with the assistance of photogenerated electrons.Also, a mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 was proposed, as shown in Scheme 3. TiO 2 adsorbs light to generate electron-hole pairs, which are then separated to be electrons and holes.The electrons transfer through MgAl-LDO layer by tunneling effect to Pt cocatalysts and participate in CO 2 reduction reaction.Meanwhile, CO 2 is chemisorbed on MgAl-LDO layered TiO 2 to form m-A species.The chemisorbed CO 2 A is mainly reduced to be adsorbed CO via one-electron transfer process.Adsorbed CO subsequently is desorbed to produce CO or further reduced and protonated by electrons and atomic H from H 2 O with a successive electron-transfer process to generate CH 4 .On other hand, the holes in the valence band is trapped by water to generate O 2 .

A species in the presence of H 2 O.A possible reason for these differences might be attributed to the dissociation of adsorbed H 2 O (H 2 O !H OH A ) on the surface Lewis acid sites (coordinately unsaturated Al 3 ) and thus formed Al-OH group, and then m-CO 3 2A Illustration of the mechanism toward the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor. 3 2A distinctly decreased, indicating m-CO 3 2A species might participate in Scheme 3. Scheme 2. A possible reaction pathway for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 . 505152lated to decrease the energy barrier for CO 2 reduction505152.The enhanced CO 2 reduction on Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 photocatalyst could be explained by considering the larger number of Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites in MgAl-LDO, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in the CO 2 reduction process.A new peak appeared at 2922 cm A1 assigned to vibration of C-H, which may be generated from the product of CH 4 via a multistep reduction.Moreover, the peak intensity of OH groups was obviously decreased, suggesting that H 2 O oxidation reaction occurred.Unfortunately, the characteristic FTIR peaks for other possible intermediates, such as CO, HCOOH, CH 2 O and CH 3 OH, were not distinguished, which might be owing to the low amount without the detection limit of FTIR instrumentation.Based on the above results, a possible route for the conversion of surface m-CO 3 2A to CO 2 A species in the presence of H 2 O are proposed (Scheme 2), that is, the adsorbed H 2 O molecule was dissociated to form surface OH A and H , followed by m-CO 3 2A species coordinated with the dissociated H to form the active reaction intermediate of m-HCO 3 A .As the CAO bond of m-HCO 3 A could be weaken via hydrogen bonding interaction, CAO bond would be easily cleaved to form CO 2 A species with the assistance of photogenerated electrons.Also, a mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over Pt/MgAl-LDO/TiO 2 was proposed, as shown in Scheme 3. TiO 2 adsorbs light to generate electron-hole pairs, which are then separated to be electrons and holes.The electrons transfer through MgAl-LDO layer by tunneling effect to Pt cocatalysts and participate in CO 2 reduction reaction.Meanwhile, CO 2 is chemisorbed on MgAl-LDO layered TiO 2 to form m-A species.The chemisorbed CO 2 A is mainly reduced to be adsorbed CO via one-electron transfer process.Adsorbed CO subsequently is desorbed to produce CO or further reduced and protonated by electrons and atomic H from H 2 O with a successive electron-transfer process to generate CH 4 .On other hand, the holes in the valence band is trapped by water to generate O 2 .
