The crystallographic phases for the materials prepared as described above were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance, CuKa radiation source).The XRD data were analyzed by using whole pattern tting (the LeBail method) using the Bruker Topas 3 program to extract the lattice parameter and crystallite size; the space group was cubic (Pm 3m, no.221).The morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7401F, JEOL) and the UV-Vis diffuse reectance spectra were recorded with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere device (UV-2550, Shimadzu) at room temperature and transformed to the absorption spectra according to the Kubelka-Munk relationship.Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were recorded using a Renishaw 1000 Raman system using a 325 nm laser at room temperature. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , 100 mg of photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed in a 128 ml borosilicate glass reactor.A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source for the photocatalytic reaction.6 ml of deionized water was added into the reaction system as an electron donor.The reactor was purged with argon gas for 10 minutes.Before irradiation, the gaseous substances in the headspace of the reactor were injected into a gas chromatograph (Varian, GC-450) using a gastight syringe (Hamilton, 1001 LTN) to make sure there were no measurable carbohydrates (including methane, methanol, etc.) in the reactor and to ensure no air is introduced to the system.A two hour photo-oxidation pre-treatment run was carried out in an argon gas environment to remove any carbon residue on the photocatalyst surface.The reaction system was then purged with CO 2 (BOC, zero grade) for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment.During the experiment, about 1.0 ml of gas was continually taken from the headspace of the reaction cell at given time intervals for product analysis using the GC which is equipped with both TCD and FID detectors.CH 4 and CO amounts were analyzed using a highly sensitive FID detector equipped with a methanizer.O 2 levels were measured using a TCD detector.The oxygen yield was obtained aer careful calculation, in which possible leakage during sampling and the dead area of the gas-tight syringe were taken into consideration.For the isotopic 13 CO 2 experiment, the same photocatalytic reaction procedure was used.Aer adding 100 mg photocatalyst into 6 ml of CO 2 saturated water, the septa-sealed reactor was purged with argon gas for 10 minutes.Then, 13 CO 2 ( 13 C 99, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was introduced.The sample was irradiated with a 150 W Xe lamp for 30 minutes, and then 0.5 ml of the reaction product taken from the vessel headspace was analyzed by mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Shimadzu QP-2010SE) with a molecular sieve 5 A capillary column.Helium was used as carrier gas during the measurement.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "nano-KTaO 3", "source": "In summary, we have synthesised nano-KTaO 3 photocatalysts by different methods and for the rst time successfully used them to reduce CO 2 under UV light irradiation in an aqueous suspension system without the need for any sacricial reagents and electrical bias.", "context": "In summary, we have synthesised nano-KTaO 3 photocatalysts by different methods and for the rst time successfully used them to reduce CO 2 under UV light irradiation in an aqueous suspension system without the need for any sacricial reagents and electrical bias.Both reduction and oxidation products have been simultaneously observed over the photocatalyst alone without any cocatalyst indicating that water served as an electron donor for CO 2 reduction.It has been conrmed that CO is produced from CO 2 reduction by using isotope labelled 13 CO 2 .It has also been found that photocatalytic activity depends on the particle size and morphologies.The nanoake-like Hex-KTO shows the best activity for both H 2 production and CO 2 reduction, achieving 20 times (H 2 ) and 7 times (CO) higher activity than the cubic sample prepared by solid state reaction.Pt loading was found to have a positive effect on hydrogen production, but suppresses CO 2 photoreduction.However, the addition of an Ag cocatalyst has been found to be benecial for CO 2 reduction and the CO yield doubles with decreased hydrogen yield.Further investigation is underway to alter the selectivity, such as by using alloy cocatalysts.
