The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with gaseous H 2 O as a reductant was carried out in a quartz tubular reactor (length: 28.0 cm, 3.0 cm; volume: 159 ml) as previously described 2.A flat quartz plate was used to hold the catalyst (typically 0.1 g).A 350 W Xe-lamp (Nanshen Company, Shanghai) equipped with 420 nm cutoff filter was used as light source.The average irradiation intensity inside the reactor was 34.8 and 38.2 mW cm -2 under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively.Before the photocatalytic reaction, high purity CO 2 (99.995) was bubbled through deionized water and then flowed through the reactor for more than 1 h to ensure that air was eliminated.The reactor was then sealed and the light was turned on to start the reaction.The volume ratio of water vapor to CO 2 in the feed gas was 0.06:1.The internal temperature of the reactor was controlled at 60 2 C. The products in the gas phase were analyzed with a gas chromatograph system (GC-9790A), using a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a FFAP capillary column (30 m 0.32 mm 0.5 m) for organic compounds determination, and a thermal conductor detector (TCD) equipped with a 5A molecular sieve column (3 m 3 mm) for inorganic gas determination.The error of measurement was less than 1.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "gas phase", "source": "In this study, nitrogen-doped mesoporous TiO 2 photocatalysts were developed for CO 2 photoreduction by water in gas phase.", "context": "In this study, nitrogen-doped mesoporous TiO 2 photocatalysts were developed for CO 2 photoreduction by water in gas phase.All of the TiO 2 samples were crystallized basically in anatase phase.The TEM image revealed that the mesoporosity was originated from the close packing of the TiO 2 nanoparticles.The mesoporous structures could be well retained after nitrogen doping.With increasing nitridation temperature, the mean pore diameter increases while the surface area value decreases.The nitrogen-doped samples have good visible light absorption.XPS analysis indicates that the doped nitrogen was in the state of molecularly chemisorbed nitrogen species (N 2 ) or nitroxide species (e.g., NO and NO 2 ).
