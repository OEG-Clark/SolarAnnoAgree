To prepare Pt(on) catalysts an appropriate amount of salt was dissolved in water and TiO 2 film coated beads were impregnated with this solution.The amount of the salt was adjusted in such a way that the final solution will contain 1 mole of Pt for 1000 moles of Ti for same volume of solution as used in the sol-gel procedure.1 : 1000 Pt : Ti molar ratio was selected to obtain 0.25 wt Pt which was observed to be the effective minimum Pt loading in photocatalytic oxidation of CO 8.For annealing and calcination same cycles were applied as in TiO 2 coating.The coating was established by dipping the beads into the solution with a dipping rate of 7.5 cm/min, waiting for 10 min for impregnation and pulling them with the same speed.The beads were then dried at 120 C in air in a furnace and calcined at 400 C for half an hour.This procedure was repeated for three times for a successful coating.

To synthesize Pt promoted TiO 2 films, Pt(NH 3 ) 4 Cl 2 AEH 2 O (Johnson Matthey) was used as Pt source.Two types of Pt promoted films, Pt(on) and Pt(in) films, are prepared to see the effect of Pt addition procedure on the photocatalytic performance of the films.Pt(on) catalysts are prepared using aqueous solutions of Pt containing salt and Pt was added on a TiO 2 support via wet impregnation technique.On the other hand for Pt(in) catalysts Pt salt was added to the TiO 2 coating sol, so that Pt was added to TiO 2 framework. To prepare Pt(on) catalysts an appropriate amount of salt was dissolved in water and TiO 2 film coated beads were impregnated with this solution.The amount of the salt was adjusted in such a way that the final solution will contain 1 mole of Pt for 1000 moles of Ti for same volume of solution as used in the sol-gel procedure.1 : 1000 Pt : Ti molar ratio was selected to obtain 0.25 wt Pt which was observed to be the effective minimum Pt loading in photocatalytic oxidation of CO 8.For annealing and calcination same cycles were applied as in TiO 2 coating.The coating was established by dipping the beads into the solution with a dipping rate of 7.5 cm/min, waiting for 10 min for impregnation and pulling them with the same speed.The beads were then dried at 120 C in air in a furnace and calcined at 400 C for half an hour.This procedure was repeated for three times for a successful coating.
