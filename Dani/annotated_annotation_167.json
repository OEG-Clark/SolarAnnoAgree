Within 1 min, the water was evaporated and subsequently the thermal decomposition of urea started leading to an exothermic self-propagating redox reaction of Zn salts and urea (fuel).The material obtained after 15 min is a yellow-orange solid and the sample is termed as ZNO. Copper catalysts were prepared using two methodologies: In the first one, Cu and N were incorporated at the same time during SC method.Zn:urea molar ratio of 1 was employed, while the amount of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O corresponded with 1.5 wt of Cu in the resultant material.The preparation was carried out in a furnace for 15 min at 723 K and the material is named as Cu-ZNU.In the second preparation method, Cu was deposited over the ZNO sample by wet impregnation using a rotavapor.As in the previous case, Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O was selected as Cu precursor to deposit a Cu charge of 1.5 wt (1.5Cu/ZNO).After that, the solid was dried overnight at 373 K and calcined at 673 K for 4 h. A mesoporous zinc oxide catalyst was prepared under hydrothermal conditions using Pluronic-123 as porogen reagent (ZnO-M).A solution with Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 2H 2 O (0.015 mol) and CO(NH 2 ) 2 (0.15 mol) was prepared in deionized water (210 ml) at room temperature and then Pluronic-123 (0.015 10 -3 mol) was added with magnetic stirring to yield a transparent solution.The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 5 by addition of acetic acid.After stirring for another 2 h, the resulting solution was transferred into a hydrothermal kettle and treated at 373 K for 24 h.The solid product was filtered off, washed with deionized water several times to neutral, and dried in an oven at 353 K overnight, followed by calcination in air under static conditions at 673 K for 4 h.Subsequently, Cu impregnation was performed by wet impregnation using a rotavapor and Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O as precursor.Cu loadings selected were 0.5 wt, 1.5 wt and 3 wt, respectively.Subsequently, the solid was dried overnight at 373 K and calcined at 673 K for 4 h. Specific surface areas of the samples were calculated from N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K that were measured on a QUADRASORB instrument.The samples were also characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with a Philips PW 3040/00 X'Pert MPD/MRD diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 1.54178A) at a scanning rate of 0.2 s -1 .A Philips Tecnai 20 Transmission Electron Microscope, operating with a tungsten filament working at 200 kV, was used to obtain microimages.Optical measurements were performed with a DRS UV/Vis/NIR PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 spectrometer, while photoluminescence experiments were carried out using a Fluorescence Spectrometer PerkinElmer LS 55, with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm using a cut-off filter at 350 nm.Metallic content of photocatalysts has been quantified by Induced Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, PerkinElmer 2300 DV).The nitrogen content of the samples was determined by CHNOS analysis using a Vario EL III analyzer with temperatures in the oven and in the reduction coil of 1423 and 1123 K, respectively, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.

Compressed CO 2 (99.98,Air Liquid) and water, controlled by mass flow controllers, were passed through a controller evaporator mixer (CEM) at a molar ratio of 6.7 (CO 2 :H 2 O) to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapour.The reactor was tightly closed and maintained at a pressure of 2 bar and a temperature of 323 K.After 12 h of illumination the reaction mixture was analyzed in a gas chromatograph equipped with three columns (Hayesep, Molecular sieve and CP-Sil 5) and three detectors (a TCD and two FID).H 2 , CH 4 , CO and CH 3 OH were detected as the main reaction products.
