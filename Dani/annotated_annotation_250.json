X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), under Cu Ka radiation at a scan rate (2y) of 0.051 s A1 .The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 80 mA, respectively.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis were conducted on a Tecnai G 2 F20 S-TWIN microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done by using an ultra-high-vacuum VG ESCALAB 210 electron spectrometer equipped with a multichannel detector.The spectrum was excited by Mg Ka radiation of two anodes in the constant analyzer energy mode and operating at 200 W.All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV of the surface adventitious carbon.UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained by using the die-pressed disk sample and a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, SHIMADZU, Japan), in which BaSO 4 was used as the reflectance standard.Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the samples were evaluated using an IR Affiinity-1 FTIR spectrometer which used conventional KBr pellets in the range of 4000-500 cm A1 at room temperature.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (S BET ) of powder was recorded by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus (USA).All of the samples were degassed at 180 1C before measurement.The pore size distributions were determined using desorption data by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The BET surface area was determined by a multipoint BET method using the adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.05-0.25.Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to investigate the fate of photogenerated electrons and holes in the samples, and were measured at room temperature on an F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).The excitation wavelength is 380 nm, the scanning speed is 1200 nm min A1 , and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage is 700 V.The width of both the excitation slit and the emission slit was 1.0 nm. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a 200 mL home-made Pyrex reactor at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.The reactor has two openings which were sealed using a silicone rubber septum.A 300 W simulated solar Xe arc lamp was used as the light source and positioned 10 cm above the photocatalytic reactor.In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the sample was put into the glass reactor and 10 mL of deionized water was added.The catalyst was dispersed by ultrasonication for about 30 min to form suspension.After evaporation of water at 80 1C for 2 h, the sample was deposited on the bottom of the reactor in the form of thin films.Before irradiation, the reactor was blown with nitrogen for 30 min to remove air and ensure that the reaction system was under anaerobic conditions.CO 2 and H 2 O vapor were in situ generated by the reaction of NaHCO 3 (0.12 g, introduced into the reactor before seal) and HCl aqueous solution (0.25 mL, 4 M) which was introduced into the reactor using a syringe. 1 mL of mixed gas was taken from the reactor at given intervals (1 h) during the irradiation and used for gas component analysis by a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and a methanizer.Products were calibrated with a standard gas and determined by the retention time.The carrier gas used in the GC-2014C was high purity nitrogen.The product of the experiment was also analyzed by another gas chromatograph (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, 5 A molecular sieve column) which also used nitrogen as carrier gas.Blank experiments were carried out in the absence of CO 2 or light irradiation to confirm that CO 2 and light were two key influencing elements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Control experiments were also used to verify whether the carbon resource was derived from CO 2 or the catalyst itself.
