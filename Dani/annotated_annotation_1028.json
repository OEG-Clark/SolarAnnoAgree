To prepare the TiO 2 NFs, sintering was performed followed by electrospinning.First, 1.18 M of titanium butoxide was stirred in ethanol solution for 30 min.Then, 0.7 g of PVP was added and stirred until it had dissolved completely (12 h).Finally, 0.6 mL of acetylacetone was added and stirred for 1 h until the solution turned yellow.The viscosity of the as-prepared solution was measured as 243.7 2.5 cP using a viscometer (DV2TLVCJ0; Brookfield).Then the solution was transferred into a 10 mL syringe with a stainless-steel needle (25 G) for electrospinning.A high DC voltage (20 kV) was applied and the solution (10 L/min) was ejected onto a flat collector having distance of 110 mm from the needle.The atmospheric conditions were humidity 15 and temperature 25 C. The electrospun NFs were collected every 3 h and dried in an oven at 60 C for 2 h.The NFs were sintered at 600 C for 4 h using a box furnace under an air atmosphere.For subsequent characterization, the TiO 2 NFs were used without further treatment. To synthesize MoS 2 nanosheets grown on the surface of the TiO 2 NFs, 0.1 g of NFs were sonicated in distilled water using an ultrasonic horn for 10 min.After that, 0.1 g of Na 2 MoO 4 and 0.2 g of thiourea were added and stirred until completely dissolved.The solution was transferred to a Teflon mold at 200 C for 24 h to grow the flower-like MoS 2 nanosheets by the hydrothermal method.After cooling, the TiO 2 NFs with MoS 2 were centrifuged several times with distilled water and ethanol to remove any salt and residue, until a pH of 7 was reached.Finally, the obtained catalyst, which has a dark grey color, was dried in an oven.We denote this material TiO 2 /MoS 2 .For subsequent characterization, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 was used without further treatment. g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were synthesized by exfoliating g-C 3 N 4 through AA treatment 36.First, 20 g of melamine precursor was sintered at 550 C for 4 h (3 C/min).The obtained bulk g-C 3 N 4 was ground using a mortar and the required amount of g-C 3 N 4 was added into distilled water.Then, 1 mL of AA was added, and the solution was sonicated for 30 min.The sonicated solution was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol until it reached a pH of 7. The washed, AA-treated g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were dried at 60 C for 2 h in an oven.We denote these nanosheets g-C 3 N 4 .For subsequent characterization, the g-C 3 N 4 was used without further treatment. We used a solvothermal method to uniformly coat the g-C 3 N 4 on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 .First, 100 mg of TiO 2 /MoS 2 was stirred in 25 mL of ethanol for 1 h.Simultaneously, certain amounts of AA-treated g-C 3 N 4 was sonicated to ensure good dispersion in 25 mL of ethanol for 1 h.Then, the g-C 3 N 4 solution was transferred into the TiO 2 /MoS 2 solution and stirred for 1 h.This solution was again transferred into the Teflon mold at 150 C for 4 h (10 C/min) for the application of the solvothermal method.After cooling, the obtained powders were dried using a rotary evaporator.The successfully synthesized heterostructures, which have a light grey color, are denoted as TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1, TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 -2, and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 depending on whether the amount of g-C 3 N 4 (50, 75, or 100 mg, respectively); each was produced with the same mass (100 mg) of TiO 2 /MoS 2 .Furthermore, photoresponsive films were fabricated by spin-coating.First, 200 mg of the fabricated catalysts were prepared separately in 1.5 mL of ethanol.After dissolving completely, the solution was spin-coated on FTO (11 cm 2 ) at 2500 rpm for 60 s and then dried in the oven for 2 h.The dried films were sintered at 150 C for 1 h to remove the remaining ethanol solution; in this way, the photoresponsive films were fabricated so that their photoelectrochemical properties and capacity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction could be evaluated.

The TiO 2 NFs with TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 were analyzed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV (FE-SEM; S4800; Hitachi, Japan) and a scanning transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV (TEM; JEM2100F; JEOL, Japan).High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used for elemental mapping of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.X-ray diffraction (D/Max-2500/PC Cu K source, 1.5418A; Rigaku, Japan) was used to detect the TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N crystalline phases.We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; K-Alpha Al K source; Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) to measure the chemical binding energies of the TiO 2 NFs with TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 after calibrating its peak of C1s at 284.8 eV.Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; iS10; Thermo Fisher Scientific) confirmed the presence of specific g-C 3 N 4 peaks.We used UV-Vis spectroscopy (V650; JASCO, Japan) to measure the optical absorbance, which relates to the bandgap energy.We carried out photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (FL920; Edinburgh Instruments, UK) studies to observe the recombination and carrier lifetimes, respectively, of the as-prepared samples under 325 nm laser excitation.We analyzed the CO 2 adsorption, specific surface area and pore size distribution of TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1, -2, and -3 based on the N 2 adsorption/desorption isoforms using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer (TriStar II 3020; Micromeritics, USA), after pretreating at 100 C for 24 h.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2/MoS2/g-C3N4", "source": "A noble-metal-free TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure with S CO2 90 was successfully produced using hydro-and solvothermal methods followed by electrospinning.", "context": "A noble-metal-free TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure with S CO2 90 was successfully produced using hydro-and solvothermal methods followed by electrospinning.Flower-like MoS 2 nanosheets were grown on TiO 2 NFs and then acetic-acid treated g-C 3 N 4 was uniformly coated.Chemical binding energy and morphological analyses revealed strong interactions among the TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 components of the heterostructure.Photoresponse analysis showed that the heterostructure showed the smallest bandgap and lowest PL intensity (470 nm), as well as the highest photocurrent density and lowest charge transfer resistance, suggesting an effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers.Moreover, TRPL analysis revealed a longer carrier lifetime for the heterostructure than for the g-C 3 N 4 .Regarding photocatalytic CO reduction, the heterostructure showed 1.9 and 3.1 times higher CO conversion than the TiO 2 NFs and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Electronic band diagrams based on the measured bandgaps, valence bands obtained by XPS, and flat band potentials indicated that the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N showed sufficient E a,CH4 (0.18 eV) to produce CH 4 during CO 2 reduction.We found that it follows S-scheme mechanism where n-type semiconductors tend to migrate the electrons from the CB of TiO 2 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 due to its formation of internal electric field, inducing recombination of pointless charge carriers, so that strong photocatalytic CO 2 reduction redox ability in the CB of MoS 2 as well as VB of TiO 2 and MoS 2, was obtained eventually.To optimize the heterostructure, the amount of g-C 3 N 4 was increased; TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3, with 100 mg of g-C 3 N 4 , showed the highest S CO2, of 90.Due to the larger surface area and smaller pore size provided by the amino (-NH 2 ) groups of g-C 3 N structure, along with well-connected interfaces, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 -3 has significantly more CO 2 adsorption sites and allows for easier electron movement, resulting in high S CO2 under light irradiation without the need to incorporate any noble metal. Suhee Kang: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Fig. (a) shows the flower-like shape of the MoS 2 on the TiO 2 NFs, which are uniformly covered with g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets; the areas labeled 1 and were analyzed in detail to confirm the presence of TiO 2 and MoS phases.Fig. 1(b) shows that the d-spacing of the flower-like MoS 2 was d (100) 0.642 nm on the TiO 2 NFs which had both rutile (d (110) 0.319 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.349 nm) phases.The uniformly coated g-C 3 N 4 was observed on the MoS 2 ; amorphous structures under the yellow dotted line can be seen in Fig. 1(c).Furthermore, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure was scanned via HAADF-STEM for elemental mapping, to confirm the uniform growth and coating status of the as-prepared materials (Fig. 1(d)).The presence of the g-C 3 N 4 coating on the TiO 2 / MoS 2 was confirmed by comparison with the TEM images of the uncoated TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as shown by the HAADF-STEM elemental map in Fig. S2.After magnifying the pink dotted circle in Fig. S2(a), we measured the d-spacing of the rutile (d (110) 0.315 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.341 nm) phases in the TiO 2 NFs, and the d-spacing of the MoS 2 (d (110) 0.643 nm) on the TiO 2 NFs, as shown in Fig. S2(b).As shown in Fig. S2(c), in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure, we only detected the elements O, S, Ti, and Mo.Therefore, MoS 2 was grown successfully on the TiO 2 NFs, while g-C 3 N 4 was uniformly coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures (indicated by the presence of C, O, S, Ti, Mo, and N).X-ray diffraction was used to evaluate the crystalline phases of all prepared samples; the results are shown in Fig. 1(e).Peaks for crystalline TiO 2 appeared at 25.22, 38.22, 47.96, 53.81, 54.98, 62.03, and 70.21 , which correspond to index planes of the anatase phase (No. 72-7058) of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), and (220) respectively.The peaks at 27.39, 36.02,39.10, 41.24, 44.02, 54.32, 56.52, 62.72, 68.96, 69.76, and 76.42 of the rutile phase (No. 75-1748) correspond to the (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), (220), (002), (301), (112), and (202) planes, respectively.The peaks for MoS 2 at 14.23, 33.02, 39.62, 49.53, and 58.87 correspond to the (002), (100), (103), (105), and (110) planes (No. 75-1539), respectively.Moreover, we ascribed the peaks detected for g-C 3 N 4 at 12.87 and 27.85 to the (100) plane for the tri-s-triazine structural packing, and the (002) plane for the inter-planar spacing, of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively37.However, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 structures showed low-intensity MoS 2 phases compared to their TiO 2 phases, due to the small amounts of their MoS precursors.In the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, no significant peaks for g-C 3 N 4 were observed due to overlapping with the rutile (101) plane.To investigate the presence of g-C 3 N 4 , FTIR analysis of g-C 3 N 4 peaks was performed, as shown in Fig.1(f).The TiO 2 NFs showed peaks at 691.6 and 510.1 cm -1 , which were related to Ti-O bonds38.After the MoS 2 had been grown on the TiO 2 NFs, and g-C 3 N 4 coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the Ti-O bond peak at 691.6 cm -1 was broader compared to that of the bare TiO 2 NFs, indicating successful MoS coating of the NFs.The bare g-C 3 N 4 showed peaks corresponding to C-N heterocycles at 1644.5, 1558.7,1453.5, 1415.5, 1327.4,and 1243.8 cm -1 , and breathing vibration of tri-s-triazine at 805.1 cm -1 39.As expected, g-C 3 N 4 peaks were detected for the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.Heterocycle rings were observed with TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N at 1634.0, 1557.4,1455.6,1408.8,1320.3, and 1243.7 cm -1 , attributed to aromatic C--N and the C-N stretching mode.Graphite-like sp bonding for tri-s-triazine was observed at 807.7 cm -1 Fig. 1.TEM images of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (a) at low magnification and (b) high magnification, showing the TiO 2 and MoS 2 d-spacings and (c) the interfaces between MoS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .(d) HADDF-STEM with EDS mappings.(e) XRD analysis and (f) FT-IR analysis of TiO 2 nanofibers of TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 .

To prepare the TiO 2 NFs, sintering was performed followed by electrospinning.First, 1.18 M of titanium butoxide was stirred in ethanol solution for 30 min.Then, 0.7 g of PVP was added and stirred until it had dissolved completely (12 h).Finally, 0.6 mL of acetylacetone was added and stirred for 1 h until the solution turned yellow.The viscosity of the as-prepared solution was measured as 243.7 2.5 cP using a viscometer (DV2TLVCJ0; Brookfield).Then the solution was transferred into a 10 mL syringe with a stainless-steel needle (25 G) for electrospinning.A high DC voltage (20 kV) was applied and the solution (10 L/min) was ejected onto a flat collector having distance of 110 mm from the needle.The atmospheric conditions were humidity 15 and temperature 25 C. The electrospun NFs were collected every 3 h and dried in an oven at 60 C for 2 h.The NFs were sintered at 600 C for 4 h using a box furnace under an air atmosphere.For subsequent characterization, the TiO 2 NFs were used without further treatment. To synthesize MoS 2 nanosheets grown on the surface of the TiO 2 NFs, 0.1 g of NFs were sonicated in distilled water using an ultrasonic horn for 10 min.After that, 0.1 g of Na 2 MoO 4 and 0.2 g of thiourea were added and stirred until completely dissolved.The solution was transferred to a Teflon mold at 200 C for 24 h to grow the flower-like MoS 2 nanosheets by the hydrothermal method.After cooling, the TiO 2 NFs with MoS 2 were centrifuged several times with distilled water and ethanol to remove any salt and residue, until a pH of 7 was reached.Finally, the obtained catalyst, which has a dark grey color, was dried in an oven.We denote this material TiO 2 /MoS 2 .For subsequent characterization, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 was used without further treatment. g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were synthesized by exfoliating g-C 3 N 4 through AA treatment 36.First, 20 g of melamine precursor was sintered at 550 C for 4 h (3 C/min).The obtained bulk g-C 3 N 4 was ground using a mortar and the required amount of g-C 3 N 4 was added into distilled water.Then, 1 mL of AA was added, and the solution was sonicated for 30 min.The sonicated solution was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol until it reached a pH of 7. The washed, AA-treated g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were dried at 60 C for 2 h in an oven.We denote these nanosheets g-C 3 N 4 .For subsequent characterization, the g-C 3 N 4 was used without further treatment.

Suhee Kang: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Fig. (a) shows the flower-like shape of the MoS 2 on the TiO 2 NFs, which are uniformly covered with g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets; the areas labeled 1 and were analyzed in detail to confirm the presence of TiO 2 and MoS phases.Fig. 1(b) shows that the d-spacing of the flower-like MoS 2 was d (100) 0.642 nm on the TiO 2 NFs which had both rutile (d (110) 0.319 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.349 nm) phases.The uniformly coated g-C 3 N 4 was observed on the MoS 2 ; amorphous structures under the yellow dotted line can be seen in Fig. 1(c).Furthermore, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure was scanned via HAADF-STEM for elemental mapping, to confirm the uniform growth and coating status of the as-prepared materials (Fig. 1(d)).The presence of the g-C 3 N 4 coating on the TiO 2 / MoS 2 was confirmed by comparison with the TEM images of the uncoated TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as shown by the HAADF-STEM elemental map in Fig. S2.After magnifying the pink dotted circle in Fig. S2(a), we measured the d-spacing of the rutile (d (110) 0.315 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.341 nm) phases in the TiO 2 NFs, and the d-spacing of the MoS 2 (d (110) 0.643 nm) on the TiO 2 NFs, as shown in Fig. S2(b).As shown in Fig. S2(c), in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure, we only detected the elements O, S, Ti, and Mo.Therefore, MoS 2 was grown successfully on the TiO 2 NFs, while g-C 3 N 4 was uniformly coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures (indicated by the presence of C, O, S, Ti, Mo, and N).X-ray diffraction was used to evaluate the crystalline phases of all prepared samples; the results are shown in Fig. 1(e).Peaks for crystalline TiO 2 appeared at 25.22, 38.22, 47.96, 53.81, 54.98, 62.03, and 70.21 , which correspond to index planes of the anatase phase (No. 72-7058) of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), and (220) respectively.The peaks at 27.39, 36.02,39.10, 41.24, 44.02, 54.32, 56.52, 62.72, 68.96, 69.76, and 76.42 of the rutile phase (No. 75-1748) correspond to the (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), (220), (002), (301), (112), and (202) planes, respectively.The peaks for MoS 2 at 14.23, 33.02, 39.62, 49.53, and 58.87 correspond to the (002), (100), (103), (105), and (110) planes (No. 75-1539), respectively.Moreover, we ascribed the peaks detected for g-C 3 N 4 at 12.87 and 27.85 to the (100) plane for the tri-s-triazine structural packing, and the (002) plane for the inter-planar spacing, of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively37.However, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 structures showed low-intensity MoS 2 phases compared to their TiO 2 phases, due to the small amounts of their MoS precursors.In the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, no significant peaks for g-C 3 N 4 were observed due to overlapping with the rutile (101) plane.To investigate the presence of g-C 3 N 4 , FTIR analysis of g-C 3 N 4 peaks was performed, as shown in Fig.1(f).The TiO 2 NFs showed peaks at 691.6 and 510.1 cm -1 , which were related to Ti-O bonds38.After the MoS 2 had been grown on the TiO 2 NFs, and g-C 3 N 4 coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the Ti-O bond peak at 691.6 cm -1 was broader compared to that of the bare TiO 2 NFs, indicating successful MoS coating of the NFs.The bare g-C 3 N 4 showed peaks corresponding to C-N heterocycles at 1644.5, 1558.7,1453.5, 1415.5, 1327.4,and 1243.8 cm -1 , and breathing vibration of tri-s-triazine at 805.1 cm -1 39.As expected, g-C 3 N 4 peaks were detected for the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.Heterocycle rings were observed with TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N at 1634.0, 1557.4,1455.6,1408.8,1320.3, and 1243.7 cm -1 , attributed to aromatic C--N and the C-N stretching mode.Graphite-like sp bonding for tri-s-triazine was observed at 807.7 cm -1 Fig. 1.TEM images of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (a) at low magnification and (b) high magnification, showing the TiO 2 and MoS 2 d-spacings and (c) the interfaces between MoS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .(d) HADDF-STEM with EDS mappings.(e) XRD analysis and (f) FT-IR analysis of TiO 2 nanofibers of TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 .

To prepare the TiO 2 NFs, sintering was performed followed by electrospinning.First, 1.18 M of titanium butoxide was stirred in ethanol solution for 30 min.Then, 0.7 g of PVP was added and stirred until it had dissolved completely (12 h).Finally, 0.6 mL of acetylacetone was added and stirred for 1 h until the solution turned yellow.The viscosity of the as-prepared solution was measured as 243.7 2.5 cP using a viscometer (DV2TLVCJ0; Brookfield).Then the solution was transferred into a 10 mL syringe with a stainless-steel needle (25 G) for electrospinning.A high DC voltage (20 kV) was applied and the solution (10 L/min) was ejected onto a flat collector having distance of 110 mm from the needle.The atmospheric conditions were humidity 15 and temperature 25 C. The electrospun NFs were collected every 3 h and dried in an oven at 60 C for 2 h.The NFs were sintered at 600 C for 4 h using a box furnace under an air atmosphere.For subsequent characterization, the TiO 2 NFs were used without further treatment. To synthesize MoS 2 nanosheets grown on the surface of the TiO 2 NFs, 0.1 g of NFs were sonicated in distilled water using an ultrasonic horn for 10 min.After that, 0.1 g of Na 2 MoO 4 and 0.2 g of thiourea were added and stirred until completely dissolved.The solution was transferred to a Teflon mold at 200 C for 24 h to grow the flower-like MoS 2 nanosheets by the hydrothermal method.After cooling, the TiO 2 NFs with MoS 2 were centrifuged several times with distilled water and ethanol to remove any salt and residue, until a pH of 7 was reached.Finally, the obtained catalyst, which has a dark grey color, was dried in an oven.We denote this material TiO 2 /MoS 2 .For subsequent characterization, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 was used without further treatment. g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were synthesized by exfoliating g-C 3 N 4 through AA treatment 36.First, 20 g of melamine precursor was sintered at 550 C for 4 h (3 C/min).The obtained bulk g-C 3 N 4 was ground using a mortar and the required amount of g-C 3 N 4 was added into distilled water.Then, 1 mL of AA was added, and the solution was sonicated for 30 min.The sonicated solution was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol until it reached a pH of 7.

We used a solvothermal method to uniformly coat the g-C 3 N 4 on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 .First, 100 mg of TiO 2 /MoS 2 was stirred in 25 mL of ethanol for 1 h.Simultaneously, certain amounts of AA-treated g-C 3 N 4 was sonicated to ensure good dispersion in 25 mL of ethanol for 1 h.Then, the g-C 3 N 4 solution was transferred into the TiO 2 /MoS 2 solution and stirred for 1 h.This solution was again transferred into the Teflon mold at 150 C for 4 h (10 C/min) for the application of the solvothermal method.After cooling, the obtained powders were dried using a rotary evaporator.The successfully synthesized heterostructures, which have a light grey color, are denoted as TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1, TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 -2, and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 depending on whether the amount of g-C 3 N 4 (50, 75, or 100 mg, respectively); each was produced with the same mass (100 mg) of TiO 2 /MoS 2 .Furthermore, photoresponsive films were fabricated by spin-coating.First, 200 mg of the fabricated catalysts were prepared separately in 1.5 mL of ethanol.After dissolving completely, the solution was spin-coated on FTO (11 cm 2 ) at 2500 rpm for 60 s and then dried in the oven for 2 h.The dried films were sintered at 150 C for 1 h to remove the remaining ethanol solution; in this way, the photoresponsive films were fabricated so that their photoelectrochemical properties and capacity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction could be evaluated. The transient photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using a three-electrode quartz cell in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 and a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 4; Princeton Applied Research, Princeton, USA).As-prepared photoresponsive film, Pt wire, and Ag/ AgCl were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.The transient photocurrent was measured while 1 V of bias potential was applied via the reference electrode.The EIS were measured at frequencies of 10 5 -0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV (biased at 1 V).Mott-Schottky plots were obtained at different frequencies.All photoelectrochemical properties were measured under UV-visible (UV-Vis) irradiation (12 mW/cm 2 ) using a 300-W Xe-arc lamp (66,984; Newport, USA).

The transient photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using a three-electrode quartz cell in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 and a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 4; Princeton Applied Research, Princeton, USA).As-prepared photoresponsive film, Pt wire, and Ag/ AgCl were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.The transient photocurrent was measured while 1 V of bias potential was applied via the reference electrode.The EIS were measured at frequencies of 10 5 -0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV (biased at 1 V).Mott-Schottky plots were obtained at different frequencies.All photoelectrochemical properties were measured under UV-visible (UV-Vis) irradiation (12 mW/cm 2 ) using a 300-W Xe-arc lamp (66,984; Newport, USA). To study the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the as-prepared samples, we used a homemade stainless steel reactor with a volume of 260 mL.First, 22 vol of triethanolamine in 125 mL of the aqueous solution was added as a hole scavenger.Approximately 20 mg of the catalyst was coated on the FTO.Prior to reaction, the reactor was tightly sealed with a connector and CO 2 gas was then added up to 0.2 MPa to saturate the aqueous solution, adsorbing CO 2 molecules into the catalyst.The gases thus produced were detected by a fused-silica capillary column with a pulsed discharge detector (6500 GC; YL Instruments, Republic of Korea) and helium was employed as a carrier gas.To ensure the reliability of the measurements, all prepared films were tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction up to three times, with new samples used each time under the same conditions.Moreover, we performed a recycling test to assess the stability of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure under the same conditions: after one cycle, used films were washed with deionized water overnight for the next run. The TiO 2 NFs with TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 were analyzed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV (FE-SEM; S4800; Hitachi, Japan) and a scanning transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV (TEM; JEM2100F; JEOL, Japan).High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used for elemental mapping of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.X-ray diffraction (D/Max-2500/PC Cu K source, 1.5418A; Rigaku, Japan) was used to detect the TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N crystalline phases.We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; K-Alpha Al K source; Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) to measure the chemical binding energies of the TiO 2 NFs with TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 after calibrating its peak of C1s at 284.8 eV.Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; iS10; Thermo Fisher Scientific) confirmed the presence of specific g-C 3 N 4 peaks.We used UV-Vis spectroscopy (V650; JASCO, Japan) to measure the optical absorbance, which relates to the bandgap energy.We carried out photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (FL920; Edinburgh Instruments, UK) studies to observe the recombination and carrier lifetimes, respectively, of the as-prepared samples under 325 nm laser excitation.We analyzed the CO 2 adsorption, specific surface area and pore size distribution of TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1, -2, and -3 based on the N 2 adsorption/desorption isoforms using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer (TriStar II 3020; Micromeritics, USA), after pretreating at 100 C for 24 h.", "vote": "1"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "First, 22 vol of triethanolamine in 125 mL of the aqueous solution was added as a hole scavenger.", "context": "To produce TiO 2 NFs, titanium butoxide, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; MW 360,000), ethanol, and acetylacetone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany), Wako (Japan), Dae-Jung (Republic of Korea), and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.For bulk g-C 3 N 4 and exfoliation treatment, melamine precursor and AA were purchased from Junsei (Japan) and Dae-Jung (Republic of Korea), respectively.Sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 ) and triethanolamine were purchased from SAM-CHUN (Republic of Korea) to evaluate the photoresponse properties of the transient photocurrent and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, respectively.Conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (15 m) was used as a substrate to fabricate the films.All chemicals were used directly, without any further purification.

Suhee Kang: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Fig. (a) shows the flower-like shape of the MoS 2 on the TiO 2 NFs, which are uniformly covered with g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets; the areas labeled 1 and were analyzed in detail to confirm the presence of TiO 2 and MoS phases.Fig. 1(b) shows that the d-spacing of the flower-like MoS 2 was d (100) 0.642 nm on the TiO 2 NFs which had both rutile (d (110) 0.319 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.349 nm) phases.The uniformly coated g-C 3 N 4 was observed on the MoS 2 ; amorphous structures under the yellow dotted line can be seen in Fig. 1(c).Furthermore, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure was scanned via HAADF-STEM for elemental mapping, to confirm the uniform growth and coating status of the as-prepared materials (Fig. 1(d)).The presence of the g-C 3 N 4 coating on the TiO 2 / MoS 2 was confirmed by comparison with the TEM images of the uncoated TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as shown by the HAADF-STEM elemental map in Fig. S2.After magnifying the pink dotted circle in Fig. S2(a), we measured the d-spacing of the rutile (d (110) 0.315 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.341 nm) phases in the TiO 2 NFs, and the d-spacing of the MoS 2 (d (110) 0.643 nm) on the TiO 2 NFs, as shown in Fig. S2(b).As shown in Fig. S2(c), in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure, we only detected the elements O, S, Ti, and Mo.Therefore, MoS 2 was grown successfully on the TiO 2 NFs, while g-C 3 N 4 was uniformly coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures (indicated by the presence of C, O, S, Ti, Mo, and N).X-ray diffraction was used to evaluate the crystalline phases of all prepared samples; the results are shown in Fig. 1(e).Peaks for crystalline TiO 2 appeared at 25.22, 38.22, 47.96, 53.81, 54.98, 62.03, and 70.21 , which correspond to index planes of the anatase phase (No. 72-7058) of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), and (220) respectively.The peaks at 27.39, 36.02,39.10, 41.24, 44.02, 54.32, 56.52, 62.72, 68.96, 69.76, and 76.42 of the rutile phase (No. 75-1748) correspond to the (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), (220), (002), (301), (112), and (202) planes, respectively.The peaks for MoS 2 at 14.23, 33.02, 39.62, 49.53, and 58.87 correspond to the (002), (100), (103), (105), and (110) planes (No. 75-1539), respectively.Moreover, we ascribed the peaks detected for g-C 3 N 4 at 12.87 and 27.85 to the (100) plane for the tri-s-triazine structural packing, and the (002) plane for the inter-planar spacing, of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively37.However, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 structures showed low-intensity MoS 2 phases compared to their TiO 2 phases, due to the small amounts of their MoS precursors.In the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, no significant peaks for g-C 3 N 4 were observed due to overlapping with the rutile (101) plane.To investigate the presence of g-C 3 N 4 , FTIR analysis of g-C 3 N 4 peaks was performed, as shown in Fig.1(f).The TiO 2 NFs showed peaks at 691.6 and 510.1 cm -1 , which were related to Ti-O bonds38.After the MoS 2 had been grown on the TiO 2 NFs, and g-C 3 N 4 coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the Ti-O bond peak at 691.6 cm -1 was broader compared to that of the bare TiO 2 NFs, indicating successful MoS coating of the NFs.The bare g-C 3 N 4 showed peaks corresponding to C-N heterocycles at 1644.5, 1558.7,1453.5, 1415.5, 1327.4,and 1243.8 cm -1 , and breathing vibration of tri-s-triazine at 805.1 cm -1 39.As expected, g-C 3 N 4 peaks were detected for the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.Heterocycle rings were observed with TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N at 1634.0, 1557.4,1455.6,1408.8,1320.3, and 1243.7 cm -1 , attributed to aromatic C--N and the C-N stretching mode.Graphite-like sp bonding for tri-s-triazine was observed at 807.7 cm -1 Fig. 1.TEM images of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (a) at low magnification and (b) high magnification, showing the TiO 2 and MoS 2 d-spacings and (c) the interfaces between MoS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .(d) HADDF-STEM with EDS mappings.(e) XRD analysis and (f) FT-IR analysis of TiO 2 nanofibers of TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 .

To synthesize MoS 2 nanosheets grown on the surface of the TiO 2 NFs, 0.1 g of NFs were sonicated in distilled water using an ultrasonic horn for 10 min.After that, 0.1 g of Na 2 MoO 4 and 0.2 g of thiourea were added and stirred until completely dissolved.The solution was transferred to a Teflon mold at 200 C for 24 h to grow the flower-like MoS 2 nanosheets by the hydrothermal method.After cooling, the TiO 2 NFs with MoS 2 were centrifuged several times with distilled water and ethanol to remove any salt and residue, until a pH of 7 was reached.Finally, the obtained catalyst, which has a dark grey color, was dried in an oven.We denote this material TiO 2 /MoS 2 .For subsequent characterization, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 was used without further treatment. g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were synthesized by exfoliating g-C 3 N 4 through AA treatment 36.First, 20 g of melamine precursor was sintered at 550 C for 4 h (3 C/min).The obtained bulk g-C 3 N 4 was ground using a mortar and the required amount of g-C 3 N 4 was added into distilled water.Then, 1 mL of AA was added, and the solution was sonicated for 30 min.The sonicated solution was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol until it reached a pH of 7. The washed, AA-treated g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were dried at 60 C for 2 h in an oven.We denote these nanosheets g-C 3 N 4 .For subsequent characterization, the g-C 3 N 4 was used without further treatment. We used a solvothermal method to uniformly coat the g-C 3 N 4 on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 .First, 100 mg of TiO 2 /MoS 2 was stirred in 25 mL of ethanol for 1 h.Simultaneously, certain amounts of AA-treated g-C 3 N 4 was sonicated to ensure good dispersion in 25 mL of ethanol for 1 h.Then, the g-C 3 N 4 solution was transferred into the TiO 2 /MoS 2 solution and stirred for 1 h.This solution was again transferred into the Teflon mold at 150 C for 4 h (10 C/min) for the application of the solvothermal method.After cooling, the obtained powders were dried using a rotary evaporator.The successfully synthesized heterostructures, which have a light grey color, are denoted as TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1, TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 -2, and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 depending on whether the amount of g-C 3 N 4 (50, 75, or 100 mg, respectively); each was produced with the same mass (100 mg) of TiO 2 /MoS 2 .Furthermore, photoresponsive films were fabricated by spin-coating.First, 200 mg of the fabricated catalysts were prepared separately in 1.5 mL of ethanol.After dissolving completely, the solution was spin-coated on FTO (11 cm 2 ) at 2500 rpm for 60 s and then dried in the oven for 2 h.The dried films were sintered at 150 C for 1 h to remove the remaining ethanol solution; in this way, the photoresponsive films were fabricated so that their photoelectrochemical properties and capacity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction could be evaluated. The transient photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using a three-electrode quartz cell in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 and a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 4; Princeton Applied Research, Princeton, USA).As-prepared photoresponsive film, Pt wire, and Ag/ AgCl were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.The transient photocurrent was measured while 1 V of bias potential was applied via the reference electrode.The EIS were measured at frequencies of 10 5 -0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV (biased at 1 V).Mott-Schottky plots were obtained at different frequencies.All photoelectrochemical properties were measured under UV-visible (UV-Vis) irradiation (12 mW/cm 2 ) using a 300-W Xe-arc lamp (66,984; Newport, USA). To study the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the as-prepared samples, we used a homemade stainless steel reactor with a volume of 260 mL.First, 22 vol of triethanolamine in 125 mL of the aqueous solution was added as a hole scavenger.Approximately 20 mg of the catalyst was coated on the FTO.Prior to reaction, the reactor was tightly sealed with a connector and CO 2 gas was then added up to 0.2 MPa to saturate the aqueous solution, adsorbing CO 2 molecules into the catalyst.The gases thus produced were detected by a fused-silica capillary column with a pulsed discharge detector (6500 GC; YL Instruments, Republic of Korea) and helium was employed as a carrier gas.To ensure the reliability of the measurements, all prepared films were tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction up to three times, with new samples used each time under the same conditions.Moreover, we performed a recycling test to assess the stability of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure under the same conditions: after one cycle, used films were washed with deionized water overnight for the next run.
