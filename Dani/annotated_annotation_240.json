Fig. 7.The yield of products in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in various aqueous solutions over Ni-Al LDH(Cl -) with Ni/Al 4 after photoirradiation for 10 h.: CO, : CH4, : H2, photocatalyst weight: 500 mg, CO2: 7.7 mmol, aqueous solution: 350 mL, concentration of additive: 0.1 M, light source: 400 W Hg lamp. The yield of products in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NaCl over different Ni/Al ratio of Ni-Al LDH(Cl -) after photoirradiation for 10 h.reduction of H derived from H 2 O into H 2 competitively takes place in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 in H 2 O.We expect that Ni species in Ni-Al LDH(Cl -) which function like a cocatalyst cause the selective formation of CO.The yields of CO, CH photocatalytic 4 , and H 2 were 21.0, 1.2, and 12.3 mol over Ni-Al LDH(Cl -), respectively, and the selectivity to CO (CO/CO CH 4 H 2 100) was 67 after 8 h of photoirradiation.The formation rate of CO in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 in an aqueous solution over Ni-Al LDH(Cl -) decreased with the photoirradiation time as shown in Fig. This study was partially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas \"All Nippon Artificial Photosynthesis Project for Living Earth\" (No. 2406) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO), supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and the Program for Element Strategy Initiative for Catalysts Batteries (ESICB), commissioned by the MEXT of Japan.
