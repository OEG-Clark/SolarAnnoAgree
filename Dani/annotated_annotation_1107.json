The transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin 300 kV, GA, USA) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer is used to define size.The samples are prepared on the carbon-coated Cu grid (product 01840-F, TED PELLA, INC., Redding, CA, USA).The chemical composition of perovskite QD is detected by the octane Elite EDS System.In addition, TEM is also used to observe the morphology of perovskite QD photocatalysts. We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.

The transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin 300 kV, GA, USA) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer is used to define size.The samples are prepared on the carbon-coated Cu grid (product 01840-F, TED PELLA, INC., Redding, CA, USA).The chemical composition of perovskite QD is detected by the octane Elite EDS System.In addition, TEM is also used to observe the morphology of perovskite QD photocatalysts. We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.

Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments are set up as shown in Figure 10.The catalyst film is fabricated on a glass membrane substrate ( 25 mm).The catalyst-covered substrate is then placed in a stainless steel home-made photoreactor (Volume 50 cm 3 ) equipped with a quartz window.H 2 O or EA/H 2 O is added into the chamber and CO 2 gas is continuously flowed over 30 min under dark conditions to remove unknown gases inside the chamber.Then the chamber is filled with CO 2 gas and the whole system is sealed up.The chamber is irradiated with a Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter to simulate the solar light spectrum (100 mW/cm 2 ); A Si reference cell (BS-520BK, S/N 568, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is used for calibration.The 250 L of gases are collected using a gas-tight syringe and analyzed by gas chromatography (YL 6500GC system, YL Instrument Co, Ltd., Anyang-si, Korea). is continuously flowed over 30 min under dark conditions to remove unknown gases inside the chamber.Then the chamber is filled with CO2 gas and the whole system is sealed up.The chamber is irradiated with a Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter to simulate the solar light spectrum (100 mW/cm 2 ); A Si reference cell (BS-520BK, S/N 568, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is used for calibration.The 250 L of gases are collected using a gastight syringe and analyzed by gas chromatography (YL 6500GC system, YL Instrument Co, Ltd., Anyang-si, Korea).

The transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin 300 kV, GA, USA) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer is used to define size.The samples are prepared on the carbon-coated Cu grid (product 01840-F, TED PELLA, INC., Redding, CA, USA).The chemical composition of perovskite QD is detected by the octane Elite EDS System.In addition, TEM is also used to observe the morphology of perovskite QD photocatalysts. We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.

We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.

We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.

We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.

We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.

We designed a red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 to increase the catalytic behavior of the perovskite QD photocatalyst.A co-catalyst, Ni(ppy), was incorporated into the perovskite QDs.The Ni precursor was mixed with a ligand selected for strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite QDs.The Ni complex was successfully doped via a ligand exchange process.The Ni content was detected by XPS and increased as the concentration of the Ni precursor increased.When the number of ligand exchange cycles increased, the Ni atomic ratio increased simultaneously.The red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy) underwent in-situ silanization to produce an ultrathin SiO 2 coating.The photodegradation of red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 dramatically improved after SiO 2 coating.We studied the photodegradation of various types of perovskite QDs during time-resolved PL tests.Pristine QDs/Ni(ppy) demonstrated significant PL degradation as the power of the light source increased.Time-resolved PL spectra indicated that trap-assisted recombination increased after light exposure, leading to photodegradation.With the addition of the SiO 2 shell, the photodegradation of perovskite significantly reduced.SiO 2 passivated the defects in the perovskite QDs, preventing ion migration triggered by the high-power light source.As a result, the SiO 2 -coated perovskite QDs demonstrated slower photodegradation than pristine QDs at the same power level.Moreover, the SiO 2 coating enhanced catalytic stability.In general, the catalytic behavior gradually decreased as the degree of contamination in the catalyst increased.During the absorption/desorption reaction, by-products and/or remaining molecules act as contaminants, sometimes changing the chemical composition of the catalyst, which is an irreversible reaction.Pristine QDs have exposed defects and easily undergo unwanted reactions with neighboring molecules.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of pristine QDs varied with time, while the red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 effectively prevented ion migration and defect contamination, resulting in better operational stability.Our system achieved a CO 2 reduction capacity for CO of 0.56 mol/(gh).We hypothesize that developing an effective hole scavenger for red/green perovskite QD/Ni(ppy)/SiO 2 can further improve the catalytic behavior in the future.
