Morphology-controlled brookite TiO 2 with 2 1 0 and 2 1 2 exposed crystal faces was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis 52,555657. The procedure for preparation of morphology-controlled TiO 2 without an aspect ratio control reagent such as PVA is as follows. Milli-Q water (3.0 cm 3 ) was added to 10 cm 3 of titanium(IV) ethoxide and 50 cm 3 of ethanol with vigorous stirring, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature.The resulting precipitate was centrifugally separated from the solution and dried under reduced pressure.The obtained amorphous titanium hydroxide particles (12.5 mmol) were dispersed in 30 hydrogen peroxide (40.0 cm 3 ).Then 25 ammonia (10.0 cm 3 ) and glycolic acid (18.75 mmol) were added, and yellow peroxo titanic acid (PTA) solution was obtained.After stirring the solution at ca. 60 C for 6 h to remove excess amounts of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia, an orange gelled compound was obtained.The gelled compound was dispersed in Milli-Q water (3.0 cm 3 ) and pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by addition of ammonia.Then the volume of the solution was adjusted (50.0 cm 3 ) by addition of Milli-Q water, and the solution in a Teflon bottle sealed with a stainless jacket (Sanaikagaku Co., HU-100) was heated at 200 C for 48 h in an oven.After hydrothermal treatment, the residue in the Teflon bottle was washed with Milli-Q water until ionic conductivity of the supernatant was 10 S cm -1 .The particles were dried under reduced pressure at 60 C for 12 h. Milli-Q water (3.0 cm 3 ) was added to 10 cm 3 of titanium(IV) ethoxide and 50 cm 3 of ethanol with vigorous stirring, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature.The resulting precipitate was centrifugally separated from the solution and dried under reduced pressure.The obtained amorphous titanium hydroxide particles (25.0 mmol) were dispersed in 30 hydrogen peroxide (40.0 cm 3 ).Then 25 ammonia (10.0 cm 3 ) and glycolic acid (50.0 mmol) were added, and yellow peroxo titanic acid (PTA) solution was obtained.An aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of PVA or PVP was added to the PTA solution.After stirring the solution at room temperature for 6 h to remove excess amounts of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia, an orange gelled compound was obtained.The gelled compound was dispersed in Milli-Q water (3.0 cm 3 ) and pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by addition of ammonia.Then the volume of the solution was adjusted (50.0 cm 3 ) by addition of Milli-Q water, and the solution in a Teflon bottle sealed with a stainless jacket (Sanaikagaku Co., HU-100) was heated at 200 C for 48 h in an oven.After hydrothermal treatment, the residue in the Teflon bottle was washed with Milli-Q water until ionic conductivity of the supernatant was 10 S cm -1 .The particles were dried under reduced pressure at 60 C for 12 h. For photodeposition of Au, an aqueous suspension consisting of brookite TiO 2 particles (200 mg) and 50 mL of an ethanol solution (8 vol) containing an appropriate amount of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) tetrahydrate was photoirradiated with a light-emitting diode (Nichia, NCCU033), which emitted light at a wavelength of ca.365 nm and an intensity of 0.3 mW cm -2 , under a nitrogen atmosphere with vigorous magnetic stirring for 24 h.For photodeposition of Ag, an aqueous suspension consisting of TiO 2 particles (200 mg) and 50 mL of Milli-Q water containing an appropriate amount of silver nitrate was photoirradiated under the same conditions.After irradiation, photodeposited samples were obtained by washing with water several times and drying.The net amount of Au or Ag on the TiO 2 surface was estimated by analysis of the filtrate with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES; Shimadzu, ICPS-8000).ICP analysis revealed that the net molar amounts of Au and Ag compounds photodeposited on the brookite TiO 2 by photodeopsition were more than 99 of the provided molar amounts of Au and Ag. Crystal structures of the TiO 2 powders were characterized by using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, MiniFlex II) with Cu K radiation ( 1.5405A).Primary particle sizes of the prepared samples were estimated from peaks at 37 which are attributed to brookite 1 2 1 in XRD patterns using the Scherrer equation: d 0.9 /cosA, where is the wavelength of X-rays, A is the Bragg angle and is the full width at half maximum. was estimated by fitting the XRD patterns with a superposition of Lorentz functions for peaks attributed to brookite.Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra were measured using a UV-VIS spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-2500PC and 2600) equipped with an integrating sphere unit (ISR-240A and ISR-2600plus).Specific surface area (S BET ) of the particles was determined with a surface area analyzer (Quantachrome, Nova 4200e) by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation.The morphology of prepared TiO 2 particles was observed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL, JSM-6701FONO) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM; Hitachi, H-9000NAR).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained by using Kratos AXIS NOVA equipped with an Al K X-ray source of the dual anode.The shift of binding energy was corrected using the C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard.The net amounts of Au or Ag compounds on the hybrid photocatalysts were estimated by analysis of the filtrate with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; Shimadzu, ICPS-8000).
