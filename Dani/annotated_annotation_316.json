The Bi 2 WO 6 -TiO 2 system was prepared by using commercial TiO 2 -P25. The samples previously obtained were metallised with low Pt content (0.5 wt) following a photodeposition method.", "context": "Catalysts were prepared by following a procedure that was described elsewhere. 28,29Briefly, for the preparation of single Bi 2 WO 6 , two solutions, one of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O (0.01 mol) in glacial acetic acid (10 mL) and a second one of Na 2 WO 4 2H 2 O (0.005 mol) in bidistilled water (90 mL), were mixed to form a white suspension that was kept under stirring for 1 hour.Then, the suspension so obtained was submitted to hydrothermal treatment at 140 C for 20 h in a Teflon recipient inside a stainless steel autoclave.The precipitate was then filtered, repeatedly washed, dried overnight at 120 C and calcined at 300 C for 4 hours. The Bi 2 WO 6 -TiO 2 system was prepared by using commercial TiO 2 -P25.For this purpose, a corresponding amount of TiO 2 (50 wt) was added to the white suspension of the Bi-W precursors.Then the resulting mixture was submitted to hydrothermal treatment and calcined under the same conditions as that for Bi 2 WO 6 .This sample was named BiWO-Ti50i. The samples previously obtained were metallised with low Pt content (0.5 wt) following a photodeposition method. 30For this purpose, a necessary amount of H 2 PtCl 6 (Aldrich 99.9) as the metallic precursor was added to a solution of 2-propanol (0.3 M) used as a sacrificial agent.Afterwards, the suspension of the catalyst in this solution was irradiated under a continuous flow of N 2 to avoid reoxidation, with an Osram Ultra-Vitalux lamp with a sun-like radiation spectrum and a main emission line in the UVA range at 365 nm.An irradiation intensity of 60 W m -2 was used for 2 h, after which the powders were filtered, repeatedly washed and dried overnight at 110 C.The names for these materials will be related to those of the samples without platinum, being in this case: Pt-BW and Pt-BiWO-Ti50i. The crystalline phase and the degree of crystallinity of the samples were estimated by X-ray diffraction (XRD).XRD pat-terns were obtained on a Siemens D-501 diffractometer by using Cu K radiation (0.15406 nm). The BET surface area and porosity measurements were carried out by N 2 adsorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics 2010 instrument. The chemical composition of the samples was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) in a Panalytical Axios sequential spectrophotometer equipped with a rhodium tube as the source of radiation.Some micrographs were obtained through TEM measurements performed using a Philips CM200 instrument.The samples were dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasonicator and dropped on a copper grid. UV-vis spectra were recorded by using a Cary 100 (Varian) spectrometer in the diffuse reflectance mode (R) and transformed to a magnitude proportional to the extinction coefficient (K) through the Kubelka-Munk function, F(R).For the measurements, pellets of a mixture of samples with BaSO 4 that do not absorb in the UV-vis radiation range (white standard) were prepared.The scan range was 200-800 nm.Band gap values were estimated from the plot of the Tauc function against the photonic energy, following the method of Tandon and Gupta. 31-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Leybold-Heraeus LHS-10 spectrometer working with a constant pass energy of 50 eV.The spectrometer main chamber was maintained at a pressure 2 10 -9 Torr, and the machine was equipped with an EA-200 MCD hemispherical electron analyzer with a dual X-ray source of Al K (h) 1486.6 eV at 120 W and 30 mA.The samples were outgassed in the prechamber of the instrument at 150 C up to a pressure of 2 10 -8 Torr to remove chemisorbed water from the surface. A continuous gas-solid photocatalytic fluidised-bed reactor was used to perform the photocatalytic tests.A more detailed description of the photoreactor can be found in previous studies. 32,33The reactor was illuminated by two ultravioletlight-emitting diode (UV-LED) modules positioned in front of the Pyrex windows.Each UV-LED module consisted of 40 pieces (supplied by Nichia Corporation) with a wavelength peak of 365 38 nm.The light intensity emitted by the UV-LEDs and entering into reactor was 90 mW cm -2 .The reaction temperature was controlled by a PID controller connected to a heating system and installed in the reactor. In the first configuration, a gas stream of CO 2 (flow rate of 30 L h -1 (STP) controlled by mass flow controllers, Brooks Instruments) was fed through a saturator with H 2 O at controlled temperature.In this way, two H 2 O concentrations in the feeding stream were evaluated: 2 and 4 vol. In the second configuration, a He stream was fed through the saturator with H 2 O, while CO 2 (1 vol) was independently supplied to the system, in order to evaluate different H 2 O/CO 2 ratios in a range of 0.1-2.0. Prior to the tests, 2.2 g of the photocatalyst were mixed with 20 g of glass spheres (Lampugnani Sandblasting HI-TECH, 70-110 m of the grain size) to ensure fluidization.Then, the mixture was added to the reactor and pre-treated with the helium stream while heating.Dark equilibrium adsorption of CO 2 was achieved prior to the photocatalytic tests.UV-LED modules were switched on after the complete adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface. Additional tests in the presence of blue phosphors were carried out.For this purpose, 1 g of a commercial phosphor (RL-B model supplied by DB Chemic with excitation and emission wavelengths of 356 and 440 nm, respectively) was added to a mixture of photocatalyst and glass spheres and the same procedure was followed at several H 2 O : CO 2 ratios. The gas composition was continuously monitored by using an online quadrupole mass detector (Trace MS, ThermoQuest) and a continuous CH 4 -CO-CO 2 NDIR analyser (Uras 10, Hartmann Braun).In this way, CH 4 and CO 2 were analysed, although CO was also followed as a possible reaction intermediate.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "Bi 2 WO 6 -based materials", "source": "Several Bi 2 WO 6 -based materials have been studied for the CO 2 photo-reduction in the gas phase, using a continuous fluidised-bed reactor.", "context": "Several Bi 2 WO 6 -based materials have been studied for the CO 2 photo-reduction in the gas phase, using a continuous fluidised-bed reactor.Some of the Bi 2 WO 6 -based photocatalysts demonstrate a higher activity than commercial TiO 2 -P25.Single Bi 2 WO 6 seems to exhibit a good ability in the photo-reduction of CO 2 only at high H 2 O concentrations.Although both the presence of TiO 2 and metallisation with a low content of Pt (0.5 wt) have been proved to have a positive effect on Bi 2 WO 6 for this reaction, especially under conditions of lower H 2 O feeding, Pt-BiWO-Ti50i displays the highest CH 4 yield among all the prepared photocatalysts.This behaviour is explained through the promotion effect of Pt in the withdrawal of photogenerated electrons.

The final features of the metallised photocatalysts clearly depend on the properties of the starting material.In this sense, during the photodeposition process, not all Pt 4 is reduced to metallic Pt with the single Bi 2 WO 6 and some Pt 2 species are found in the metallised material.These species also seem to play a role in the improvement of the Pt-Bi 2 WO 6 sample. Adding blue phosphors in the reactor bed has a positive effect on the stability of the system, even at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, thanks to the improved photonic transfer to the entire reaction volume.

In the second configuration, a He stream was fed through the saturator with H 2 O, while CO 2 (1 vol) was independently supplied to the system, in order to evaluate different H 2 O/CO 2 ratios in a range of 0.1-2.0. Prior to the tests, 2.2 g of the photocatalyst were mixed with 20 g of glass spheres (Lampugnani Sandblasting HI-TECH, 70-110 m of the grain size) to ensure fluidization.Then, the mixture was added to the reactor and pre-treated with the helium stream while heating.Dark equilibrium adsorption of CO 2 was achieved prior to the photocatalytic tests.UV-LED modules were switched on after the complete adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface. Additional tests in the presence of blue phosphors were carried out.For this purpose, 1 g of a commercial phosphor (RL-B model supplied by DB Chemic with excitation and emission wavelengths of 356 and 440 nm, respectively) was added to a mixture of photocatalyst and glass spheres and the same procedure was followed at several H 2 O : CO 2 ratios. The gas composition was continuously monitored by using an online quadrupole mass detector (Trace MS, ThermoQuest) and a continuous CH 4 -CO-CO 2 NDIR analyser (Uras 10, Hartmann Braun).In this way, CH 4 and CO 2 were analysed, although CO was also followed as a possible reaction intermediate.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "continuous", "source": "Several Bi 2 WO 6 -based materials have been studied for the CO 2 photo-reduction in the gas phase, using a continuous fluidised-bed reactor.", "context": "Several Bi 2 WO 6 -based materials have been studied for the CO 2 photo-reduction in the gas phase, using a continuous fluidised-bed reactor.Some of the Bi 2 WO 6 -based photocatalysts demonstrate a higher activity than commercial TiO 2 -P25.Single Bi 2 WO 6 seems to exhibit a good ability in the photo-reduction of CO 2 only at high H 2 O concentrations.Although both the presence of TiO 2 and metallisation with a low content of Pt (0.5 wt) have been proved to have a positive effect on Bi 2 WO 6 for this reaction, especially under conditions of lower H 2 O feeding, Pt-BiWO-Ti50i displays the highest CH 4 yield among all the prepared photocatalysts.This behaviour is explained through the promotion effect of Pt in the withdrawal of photogenerated electrons. The final features of the metallised photocatalysts clearly depend on the properties of the starting material.In this sense, during the photodeposition process, not all Pt 4 is reduced to metallic Pt with the single Bi 2 WO 6 and some Pt 2 species are found in the metallised material.These species also seem to play a role in the improvement of the Pt-Bi 2 WO 6 sample. Adding blue phosphors in the reactor bed has a positive effect on the stability of the system, even at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, thanks to the improved photonic transfer to the entire reaction volume.
