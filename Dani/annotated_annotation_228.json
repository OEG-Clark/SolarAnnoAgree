contained 20 rutile and 80 anatase, was purchased from Degussa.The noble metal-promoted TiO 2 (denoted as M-TiO 2 , and M Pt, Pd, Au, Rh, or Ag) catalysts were typically prepared by a photodeposition method.For example, for the preparation of Pt-TiO 2 , a fixed amount of TiO 2 was suspended in an aqueous solution of hexachloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 ) containing 0.1 M methanol as a hole scavenger.The suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Hg lamp for 2 h.The obtained sample was recovered by filtration, followed by washing repeatedly with deionized water and drying at 373 K for 12 h.The impregnation followed by H 2 reduction and the chemical reduction with hydrazine were also employed for the preparation of Pt-promoted TiO 2 photocatalysts for comparison, and the catalysts were denoted as Pt-TiO 2 -imp-H 2 and Pt-TiO 2 -hydrazine, respectively.For the impregnation, a fixed amount of TiO 2 was suspended in an aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 .Then, water was evaporated, and the recovered solid sample was further dried.Finally, the sample was reduced in H 2 gas flow at 623 K for 2 h.For the chemical reduction with hydrazine, an aqueous solution of hydrazine was added dropwise into the suspension containing powdery TiO 2 in the aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 .After the reduction, the sample was recovered by filtration, followed by washing thoroughly with deionized water and drying overnight.MgOmodified TiO 2 samples were prepared with an impregnation method by immersing powdery TiO 2 into an aqueous solution of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 .After impregnation and drying, the sample was calcined in air at 773 K for 4 h.The MgO-and Pt-doubly modified TiO 2 (denoted as MgO-Pt-TiO 2 ) catalysts were prepared by the photodeposition of Pt onto the MgO-modified TiO 2 sample using the same procedure as that for the preparation of Pt-TiO 2 . 2.2.Characterization.The photocatalysts were characterized by a series of techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, CO 2 chemisorption, and photoelectrochemical measurements.The XRD patterns were collected on a Panalytical X'pert Pro diffractometer using Cu K radiation (40 kV, 30 mA).The TEM measurements were performed on a JEM-2100 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.The PL spectra were obtained on an Edinburgh Analytical Instrument FLS 920 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm.The amount of CO 2 chemisorption was measured at 298 K with a Micromeritics ASAP2020C apparatus by adopting the procedure reported by Teramura et al. 36 The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out with an Ivium CompactStat (Holland) using a standard three-electrode cell with a working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an SCE electrode as the reference electrode. 37A 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte.The working electrode was prepared by cleaning an F-doped SnO 2coated glass (FTO glass, 1 cm 2 cm).The photocatalyst was dispersed in ethanol, and the suspension was added dropwise directly onto the FTO by microsyringe with a gentle stream of air to speed drying.The film was dried at 393 K for 1 h, and the typical surface density of the photocatalyst was 1 mg cm -2 . 2.3.Catalytic Reaction.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was carried out in a stainless-steel reactor (volume, 100 mL) with a quartz window on the top of the reactor.The light source was 100 W Xe lamp (Beijing Trusttech Co., Ltd.) at UV-vis ( 320-780 nm).The light intensities measured by an optical power meter (Beijing Aulight Co., Ltd., CEL-NP2000-10) were 580 and 60 mW cm -2 in the ranges of 320-780 and 320-400 nm, respectively, and the fraction of the UV light in the spectrum was approximately 10.For the solid-gas interface reaction mode, 20 mg of solid catalyst was placed on a Teflon catalyst holder in the upper region of the reactor (Figure 1, left).Liquid water with a volume of 4.0 mL was precharged in the bottom of the reactor. The catalyst was surrounded by CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.The pressure of CO 2 was typically regulated to 0.2 MPa.The temperature of the reactor was kept at 323 K, and the vapor pressure of H 2 O was 12.3 kPa under such a circumstance.For the solid-liquid interface reaction mode (Figure 1, right), the catalyst was dispersed in 4.0 mL water, which was precharged in the bottom of the reactor.The pressure of CO 2 and the temperature of reactor were 0.2 MPa and 323 K, respectively, which were the same as in the solid-gas interface reactions mode.The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed for 10 h.The amounts of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 formed were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The reaction system was connected to an online GC through valves, and the gaseous products could be directly introduced to the GC for analysis.We adopted a flame ionization detector (FID) for quantifying the amounts of CO and CH 4 formed from CO 2 to ensure high sensitivities.After the effluents containing CO 2 , CO, and CH 4 were separated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, CO and CO 2 were further converted to CH 4 by a methanation reactor, and were then analyzed by the FID detector.The detection limits of our analytic method for CH 4 and CO were both 0.002 mol, corresponding to 0.5 ppm in concentration.H 2 and O 2 were analyzed by an Agilent Micro GC3000 (Micro GC) equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5A column and a highsensitivity thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Argon was used as the carrier gas.The Micro GC was connected directly to the reactor by a stainless-steel tube, and the gaseous products were introduced to the Micro GC by a self-suction type injection pump.The detection limits for H 2 and O 2 were 0.004 mol (1 ppm) and 0.2 mol (50 ppm), respectively.The relative errors for the products except for O 2 were typically lower than 5.Liquid products such as CH 3 OH, HCHO, and HCOOH possibly formed and dissolved in water were also analyzed carefully by gas chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography, but no such products were detected under our reaction conditions.We performed the same experiment (including both reaction and analysis) for at least 3 times for each catalyst, and the relative standard deviations for the amounts of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 formed were 5.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "We studied the effect of cocatalysts on catalytic behaviors of TiO 2 for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using the solid-gas interface reaction mode.", "context": "The present work focused on the development of efficient photocatalytic systems for the preferential photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.We found that the use of the solid-gas interface reaction mode, i.e., the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor, resulted in higher selectivity of photogenerated electrons toward the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 as compared to the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 .The predominant exposure of catalyst surface to H 2 O, which was the case in the solid-liquid interface reactions, could be avoided in the solid-gas interface reactions.We studied the effect of cocatalysts on catalytic behaviors of TiO 2 for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using the solid-gas interface reaction mode.Among several noble metals including Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, and Ag, Pt was the most efficient cocatalyst to extract the photogenerated electrons for the reductive reactions.The loading of Pt onto TiO 2 also increased the selectivity of CH 4 and decreased that of CO possibly because the enhanced electron density favored the eight-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .The size and loading amount of Pt also affected the photocatalytic behavior of Pt-TiO 2 catalysts.The catalysts with smaller Pt particles and proper Pt loadings favored the CH 4 formation rate and CH 4 selectivity.However, the presence of Pt also accelerated the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 , and the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction rather decreased slightly.We demonstrated that the addition of MgO to the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst significantly increased the selectivity for CO 2 reduction although the rate of electron consumption for reductive reactions did not change significantly.The presence of MgO remarkably suppressed the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 and accelerated the reduction of CO 2 .Furthermore, the addition of MgO into the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst further improved the selectivity of CH 4 in CO 2 reduction to 99.The synergistic effect between the enhanced CO 2 chemisorption and electron density on the surface of MgOand Pt-co-promoted TiO 2 is proposed to be responsible for the improvement of the selectivity for CO 2 reduction and CH 4 formation.Our work has provided important clues for selectivity control in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.

Influence of Reaction Mode on Photocatalytic Performances of TiO 2 and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 for Reduction of CO 2 in the Presence of H 2 O a by the predominant covering of the catalyst with H 2 O due to the limited solubility of CO 2 in H 2 O.This leads to higher formation rate of H 2 but lower ones of CH 4 and CO.In other words, a larger fraction of the photogenerated electrons are used for the reduction of H 2 O instead of CO 2 .The presence of Pt accelerated the rate of electron consumption for reductive reactions, i.e., R(electron), but these electrons were mainly used for the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 in the case of the solid-liquid interface reaction mode.On the other hand, the solid-gas interface reaction mode can allow the exposure of the catalyst surface to CO 2 atmosphere and avoid the predominant formation of H 2 .Thus, it becomes clear that the solid-gas interface reaction mode is more suitable for the preferential reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O. a Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.020 g; CO 2 pressure, 0.2 MPa; H 2 O, 4.0 mL; irradiation time, 10 h.caused 3.2.Effect of Noble Metal Cocatalysts.Table Catalytic Behaviors of TiO 2 Promoted by Noble Metal Cocatalysts for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 in the Presence of H 2 O Vapor a a Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.020 g; CO 2 pressure, 0.2 MPa; H 2 O, 4.0 mL; irradiation time, 10 h.bThe content of cocatalyst is 0.5 wt . c From ref38.

The catalyst was surrounded by CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.The pressure of CO 2 was typically regulated to 0.2 MPa.The temperature of the reactor was kept at 323 K, and the vapor pressure of H 2 O was 12.3 kPa under such a circumstance.For the solid-liquid interface reaction mode (Figure 1, right), the catalyst was dispersed in 4.0 mL water, which was precharged in the bottom of the reactor.The pressure of CO 2 and the temperature of reactor were 0.2 MPa and 323 K, respectively, which were the same as in the solid-gas interface reactions mode.The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed for 10 h.The amounts of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 formed were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The reaction system was connected to an online GC through valves, and the gaseous products could be directly introduced to the GC for analysis.We adopted a flame ionization detector (FID) for quantifying the amounts of CO and CH 4 formed from CO 2 to ensure high sensitivities.After the effluents containing CO 2 , CO, and CH 4 were separated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, CO and CO 2 were further converted to CH 4 by a methanation reactor, and were then analyzed by the FID detector.The detection limits of our analytic method for CH 4 and CO were both 0.002 mol, corresponding to 0.5 ppm in concentration.H 2 and O 2 were analyzed by an Agilent Micro GC3000 (Micro GC) equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5A column and a highsensitivity thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Argon was used as the carrier gas.The Micro GC was connected directly to the reactor by a stainless-steel tube, and the gaseous products were introduced to the Micro GC by a self-suction type injection pump.The detection limits for H 2 and O 2 were 0.004 mol (1 ppm) and 0.2 mol (50 ppm), respectively.The relative errors for the products except for O 2 were typically lower than 5.Liquid products such as CH 3 OH, HCHO, and HCOOH possibly formed and dissolved in water were also analyzed carefully by gas chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography, but no such products were detected under our reaction conditions.We performed the same experiment (including both reaction and analysis) for at least 3 times for each catalyst, and the relative standard deviations for the amounts of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 formed were 5.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "We found that the use of the solid-gas interface reaction mode, i.e., the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor, resulted in higher selectivity of photogenerated electrons toward the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 as compared to the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 .", "context": "The present work focused on the development of efficient photocatalytic systems for the preferential photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.We found that the use of the solid-gas interface reaction mode, i.e., the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor, resulted in higher selectivity of photogenerated electrons toward the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 as compared to the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 .The predominant exposure of catalyst surface to H 2 O, which was the case in the solid-liquid interface reactions, could be avoided in the solid-gas interface reactions.We studied the effect of cocatalysts on catalytic behaviors of TiO 2 for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using the solid-gas interface reaction mode.Among several noble metals including Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, and Ag, Pt was the most efficient cocatalyst to extract the photogenerated electrons for the reductive reactions.The loading of Pt onto TiO 2 also increased the selectivity of CH 4 and decreased that of CO possibly because the enhanced electron density favored the eight-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .The size and loading amount of Pt also affected the photocatalytic behavior of Pt-TiO 2 catalysts.The catalysts with smaller Pt particles and proper Pt loadings favored the CH 4 formation rate and CH 4 selectivity.However, the presence of Pt also accelerated the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 , and the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction rather decreased slightly.We demonstrated that the addition of MgO to the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst significantly increased the selectivity for CO 2 reduction although the rate of electron consumption for reductive reactions did not change significantly.The presence of MgO remarkably suppressed the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 and accelerated the reduction of CO 2 .Furthermore, the addition of MgO into the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst further improved the selectivity of CH 4 in CO 2 reduction to 99.The synergistic effect between the enhanced CO 2 chemisorption and electron density on the surface of MgOand Pt-co-promoted TiO 2 is proposed to be responsible for the improvement of the selectivity for CO 2 reduction and CH 4 formation.Our work has provided important clues for selectivity control in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.

Effect of MgO on Catalytic Behaviors of Pt-TiO 2 for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 in the Presence of H 2 O Vapor a Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.020 g; CO 2 pressure, 0.2 MPa; H 2 O, 4.0 mL; irradiation time, 10 h.b The loading of Pt was 0.5 wt . a shows that the hydrogenation of CO 2 or CO over our catalysts, including both Pt-TiO 2 and MgO-Pt-TiO 2 , cannot proceed under dark reaction conditions.This rules out the possibility that CH 4 is formed via the hydrogenation of CO 2 or CO under dark conditions by the hydrogen resulting from the photocatalytic reduction of H 2 O eqs 7and 8.The use of CO as a reactant instead of CO 2 under irradiation conditions could take place, producing CH 4 and H 2. This suggests that the photocatalytic reduction of CO in the presence of H 2 O, i.e., reaction 9, can Catalytic Behaviors of Pt-TiO 2 and MgO-Pt-TiO 2 in Several Control Experiments a The loading of Pt was 0.5 wt ; the content of MgO was 1.0 wt . c H 2 /CO 2 or H 2 /CO 1/99. b Downloaded by UNIV AUTONOMA DE MADRID on September 3, 2015 http://pubs.acs.orgPublication Date (Web): September 17, 2014 doi: 10.1021/cs500648p The authors declare no competing financial interest.
