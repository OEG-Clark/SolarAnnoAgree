A series of conditioned calcinations at different temperatures, gas atmospheres and treatment durations were adopted to remove ethylene glycol and other possible carbon species from the TiO 2 -0 sample (Table S1).All treatments were performed in a tube furnace under a 200 mL/ min gas flow with a heating rate of 1 C/min.On the premise of organic residue removal, three samples treated at 350 C for different durations and gas atmospheres were selected as photocatalysts.To simplify the presentation, the samples treated under the conditions of 350 C/O 2 / 2 h, 350 C/Air/4 h and 350 C/Air/10 h were denoted as TiO 2 -2, TiO 2 -4 and TiO 2 -10, respectively. For all TiO 2 -X (X 0, 2, 4, and 10) samples, X-ray diffraction was performed on an Empyrean diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.1542 nm) in the range of 10-80.Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were both performed on a confocal laser LabRAM HR800 instrument at ambient temperature.The N 2 and CO 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were both tested on an ASAP 2020 instrument from Micromeritics.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Talos F200X instrument.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Zeiss Gemini 300 instrument.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained by using Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipment with Al/Mg K radiation.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were acquired in a three-electrode quartz cell with a 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution, a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and ITO glass (1 cm 1 cm) coated with the dispersed sample served as the working electrode. Temperature programmed CO 2 desorption (TPD-CO 2 ) was performed to study the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 .In detail, a quartz tube reactor with 100 mg of catalyst loaded was first heated up to 300 C (15 C min -1 ) for 1 h under ultra-high purity He flow (30 mL min -1 ) and then cooled to ambient temperature.After that, CO 2 flow (30 mL min -1 ) passed through the catalyst bed for 1 h, followed by He flow (30 mL min -1 ) flushed for 1 h.The TPD analysis was finally performed under He flow (30 mL min--1 ) with the reactor heating up to 750 C at 10 C min -1 .The effluent gas flow was monitored by a TCD detector. A Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a Praying Mantis DRIFTS accessory was used to perform in situ the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO 2 and H 2 O coadsorption as well as the reaction intermediates on the catalysts (Fig. S1).The IR reaction chamber (Harrick Scientific, HVC-DRP) was equipped with two ZnSe windows and a quartz window for IR-and UVlight transmission.A 300 W Xe arc lamp was used as the UV-light source.In a typical process, after outgassing the internal air with ultrapure N 2 flux at a flow rate of 150 mL/min for 1 h, the IR spectrum was first collected as the background and was subtracted from the subsequent data collection.Afterwards, a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor was introduced to the IR reaction chamber for 60 min in the dark to investigate CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption.The photocatalytic activation/ conversion of adsorbed CO 2 species was studied under UV-light irradiation subsequently. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed at 120 C under UV-light irradiation in a continuous-flow reactor, as reported in our previous work 29.A 300 W Xe lamp was employed to obtain the UV light (300 nm 400 nm, 5.0 mW/cm 2 ).Typically, 20 mg of the catalyst was transferred to a Petri dish (diameter, 35 mm), dispersed ultrasonically by 5 mL of deionized water, and dried at 100 C to evaporate water.Prior to the experiment, the samples were exposed to ambient air and irradiated under UV-light overnight to remove any possible trace of contamination on the samples.Ultrapure CO 2 (99.999 ) was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture at a flow rate of 300 mL min -1 for 1 h to outgas the air, and then, at 5 mL min -1 for another 30 min to stabilize the flow.Afterwards, the Xe lamp was turned on to start the experiment.A GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a methanizer was employed to analyze the concentrations of H 2 , CO, and hydrocarbons in the exhausting gas every 30 min. Before the experiment of TiO 2 -X (X 2, 4, and 10), a blank control group was examined to exclude any carbon source in the system other than CO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction.First, a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor, as the reaction gases, was employed using: an (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with an empty Petri dish to conduct the test.In these two cases, no carbon-containing compounds were detected, whether in the dark or under UV irradiation, which demonstrated that the photocatalyst was necessary for CO 2 reduction to proceed.Second, the reaction gases were replaced by a mixture of N 2 (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor in the presence of each photocatalyst.Similarly, no carbon-containing compounds were detected under UV irradiation, indicating that the CO 2 served as the only carbon source.To exemplify the influence of organic residues for CO 2 photoreduction, the control experiment of TiO 2 -0 had also been conducted only with the supply of the mixture of water vapor and nitrogen rather than the mixture of water vapor and CO 2 .", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 -X (X 2,410)", "source": "Fig. 4.

Before the experiment of TiO 2 -X (X 2, 4, and 10), a blank control group was examined to exclude any carbon source in the system other than CO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction.First, a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor, as the reaction gases, was employed using: an (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with an empty Petri dish to conduct the test.In these two cases, no carbon-containing compounds were detected, whether in the dark or under UV irradiation, which demonstrated that the photocatalyst was necessary for CO 2 reduction to proceed.Second, the reaction gases were replaced by a mixture of N 2 (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor in the presence of each photocatalyst.Similarly, no carbon-containing compounds were detected under UV irradiation, indicating that the CO 2 served as the only carbon source.To exemplify the influence of organic residues for CO 2 photoreduction, the control experiment of TiO 2 -0 had also been conducted only with the supply of the mixture of water vapor and nitrogen rather than the mixture of water vapor and CO 2 .", "vote": "0"}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Not mentioned", "source": "N/A", "context": "Postcalcination has usually been used to remove organic residues from atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials for CO 2 photoreduction, while the effect of calcination on their structure and photocatalytic activity has remained unclear yet.In this work, the structure transformation of atomically thin 2D TiO 2 (B) nanosheets during calcination was analyzed, and the structure-function relationship was studied.The results show that after calcination at 350 C in air for 10 h, hierarchical assembly of 2D TiO 2 (B) nanosheets was collapsed into a uniform structure and the TiO 2 (B) nanosheets were decomposed into interconnected highcrystallinity anatase nanoparticles.The morphology/phase transformation enhanced the chemical binding and activation of CO 2 , and promoted the transfer/separation of photogenerated charges, resulting in the improved CO 2 photoreduction activity.This work aimed to show the importance of precise control over the postcalcination treatment for atomically thin 2D materials.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed at 120 C under UV-light irradiation in a continuous-flow reactor, as reported in our previous work 29.", "context": "Ultrathin 2D TiO 2 nanosheets, with atomic thickness, were prepared through a solvothermal approach reported elsewhere 20.Typically, 2.1 g of titanium isopropoxide was added to 1.48 g concentrated HCl solution under vigorous magnetic stirring (solution A).Then, 0.4 g of polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (PEO20-PPO70-PEO20, Pluronic P123) was dissolved in 6 g ethanol (solution B) and stirred for 15 min.Next, solution A was dropped into solution B under stirring for another 30 min.Afterwards, 5 mL of the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL autoclave together with 40 mL of ethylene glycol, which was heated at 150 C for 20 h.The solid products of the solvothermal reaction were separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times.Finally, after drying at 80 C for 24 h, the obtained white powder was collected and denoted as TiO 2 -0. A series of conditioned calcinations at different temperatures, gas atmospheres and treatment durations were adopted to remove ethylene glycol and other possible carbon species from the TiO 2 -0 sample (Table S1).All treatments were performed in a tube furnace under a 200 mL/ min gas flow with a heating rate of 1 C/min.On the premise of organic residue removal, three samples treated at 350 C for different durations and gas atmospheres were selected as photocatalysts.To simplify the presentation, the samples treated under the conditions of 350 C/O 2 / 2 h, 350 C/Air/4 h and 350 C/Air/10 h were denoted as TiO 2 -2, TiO 2 -4 and TiO 2 -10, respectively. For all TiO 2 -X (X 0, 2, 4, and 10) samples, X-ray diffraction was performed on an Empyrean diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.1542 nm) in the range of 10-80.Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were both performed on a confocal laser LabRAM HR800 instrument at ambient temperature.The N 2 and CO 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were both tested on an ASAP 2020 instrument from Micromeritics.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Talos F200X instrument.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Zeiss Gemini 300 instrument.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained by using Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipment with Al/Mg K radiation.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were acquired in a three-electrode quartz cell with a 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution, a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and ITO glass (1 cm 1 cm) coated with the dispersed sample served as the working electrode. Temperature programmed CO 2 desorption (TPD-CO 2 ) was performed to study the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 .In detail, a quartz tube reactor with 100 mg of catalyst loaded was first heated up to 300 C (15 C min -1 ) for 1 h under ultra-high purity He flow (30 mL min -1 ) and then cooled to ambient temperature.After that, CO 2 flow (30 mL min -1 ) passed through the catalyst bed for 1 h, followed by He flow (30 mL min -1 ) flushed for 1 h.The TPD analysis was finally performed under He flow (30 mL min--1 ) with the reactor heating up to 750 C at 10 C min -1 .The effluent gas flow was monitored by a TCD detector.
