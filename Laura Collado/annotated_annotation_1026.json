For the synthesis of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite, a similar approach was employed as discussed above.First, g-C 3 N 4 and Bt, dispersed in methanol, were mixed together and ultrasonicated for their uniform dispersion (sample A).In parallel, WO 3 was dispersed in methanol and stirred for uniform dispersion and named sample B. Afterward, sample B was added to sample A under continuous stirring.The suspension was ultrasonicated for developing good interaction and uniform dispersion of the materials.Finally, the suspension was centrifuged, oven-dried at 100 C, and named the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 (WBCN) composite.The schematic illustration for the synthesis of Bt/g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 is shown in Figure 1. 2.4.Characterization.The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of pristine and composite samples were obtained with an advanced Rigaku XRD diffractometer, using Cu K radiation with a wavelength of 0.154178 nm.The 2 values were obtained using a step size of 0.02 s -1 in the range of 5-80 C.To determine molecular interactions, Raman analysis was conducted using a LabRAM HR Evolution (Horiba) spectrometer.The Raman spectra were obtained with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source.The structure and morphology were further investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).The FESEM images were obtained with a Zeiss Crossbeam 340 microscope.Similarly, TEM images of the samples were taken by employing a Hitachi HT7700 microscope.The chemical bonding and oxidation states were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) analysis, recorded with an Axis Ultra DLD Shimadzu system.The binding energy (BE) was calibrated using the adventitious C 1s peak (284.60 eV) as an internal standard.The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) was characterized using a Cary 100 Agilent model G982 spectrometer, integrated with spheres for loading powder samples.The charge recombination and separation analyses were further characterized using a photoluminescence (PL) system with a 325 laser as the excitation source. 2.5.Photoactivity Test.The photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O was conducted in a gas-phase photoreactor system with the catalyst uniformly distributed inside the reactor chamber.The reactor was equipped with a glass window at the top for passing light irradiation.The lamp was fixed at the top of the glass window, and a homemade parabolic reflector was placed above the reactor window for directing light irradiation into the cylindrical vessel.Before starting the experiments, CO 2 gas carrying moisture from the water saturator and regulated by a mass flow controller was streamed through the reactor for 30 min to saturate the catalyst surface with the reactants.In order to study the effect of catalyst loading, three different amounts of catalysts, i.e., 50, 150, and 250 mg, were used, whereas all the other parameters were kept constant during the catalyst loading optimization process.As the light intensity is very important in the photocatalysis process, the two different light intensities were investigated with the help of a 35 W CAR HID lamp and 300 W Xenon lamp with light intensities of 20 and 100 mW cm -2 , respectively.Furthermore, during all the experiments, no external heating or cooling was supplied to control reactor temperature and the reactor pressure was kept equal to atmospheric pressure.The gaseous products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-HP Technologies 6890 N) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).The column employed was a Carboxen-1010 PLOT Capillary GC column (L I.D. 30 m 0.53 mm) connected with both the TCD and FID detectors.Energy Fuels", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4", "source": "In summary, the

using water as the reducing agent in a fixed bed and gas-phase photoreactor system.WO 3 / Bt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibits excellent photoactivity for both CO and CH 4 productions during the CO 2 photoreduction process under visible-light irradiation.The highest yields of CO and CH 4 of 37.4 and 118.9 mol h -1 were obtained using 150 mg of photocatalyst under 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.The amount of CH 4 production over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was 5.98-, 6.74-, and 25.19-fold higher than its production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , Bt/g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.The production of CO and CH 4 over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite varied by using different amounts of catalyst loading, providing information that interaction between light irradiation and catalyst is very important to maximize photocatalytic activity.The production rate of CH 4 was increased to 177.9 mol h -1 using 100 mW cm -2 light intensity under the same reaction conditions.A 1.49-fold improvement in performance of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was observed by increasing light intensity from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 due to more production of charge carriers over the composite photocatalyst surface.Highest QYs of 20.106 and 1.875 for CH 4 and CO were achieved over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite with a selectivity of 72.82 for methane formation.In general, the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite catalyst was due Energy Fuels to the formation of the direct Z-scheme system with higher redox potential for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 under visible-light irradiation.The stability analysis further confirms continuous fuel formation over entire irradiation time and employing multiple cycles without any decrement in productivity.The findings of the present work are expected to be utilized for constructing the Z-scheme heterojunction system without using noble metals with controlled morphology for tailoring photoinduced CO 2 reduction to fuels and which would also be helpful for other solar fuel application.

the excitation source. 2.5.Photoactivity Test.The photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O was conducted in a gas-phase photoreactor system with the catalyst uniformly distributed inside the reactor chamber.The reactor was equipped with a glass window at the top for passing light irradiation.The lamp was fixed at the top of the glass window, and a homemade parabolic reflector was placed above the reactor window for directing light irradiation into the cylindrical vessel.Before starting the experiments, CO 2 gas carrying moisture from the water saturator and regulated by a mass flow controller was streamed through the reactor for 30 min to saturate the catalyst surface with the reactants.In order to study the effect of catalyst loading, three different amounts of catalysts, i.e., 50, 150, and 250 mg, were used, whereas all the other parameters were kept constant during the catalyst loading optimization process.As the light intensity is very important in the photocatalysis process, the two different light intensities were investigated with the help of a 35 W CAR HID lamp and 300 W Xenon lamp with light intensities of 20 and 100 mW cm -2 , respectively.Furthermore, during all the experiments, no external heating or cooling was supplied to control reactor temperature and the reactor pressure was kept equal to atmospheric pressure.The gaseous products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-HP Technologies 6890 N) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).The column employed was a Carboxen-1010 PLOT Capillary GC column (L I.D. 30 m 0.53 mm) connected with both the TCD and FID detectors.Energy Fuels", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "In summary, the WO 3

water as the reducing agent in a fixed bed and gas-phase photoreactor system.WO 3 / Bt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibits excellent photoactivity for both CO and CH 4 productions during the CO 2 photoreduction process under visible-light irradiation.The highest yields of CO and CH 4 of 37.4 and 118.9 mol h -1 were obtained using 150 mg of photocatalyst under 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.The amount of CH 4 production over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was 5.98-, 6.74-, and 25.19-fold higher than its production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , Bt/g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.The production of CO and CH 4 over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite varied by using different amounts of catalyst loading, providing information that interaction between light irradiation and catalyst is very important to maximize photocatalytic activity.The production rate of CH 4 was increased to 177.9 mol h -1 using 100 mW cm -2 light intensity under the same reaction conditions.A 1.49-fold improvement in performance of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was observed by increasing light intensity from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 due to more production of charge carriers over the composite photocatalyst surface.Highest QYs of 20.106 and 1.875 for CH 4 and CO were achieved over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite with a selectivity of 72.82 for methane formation.In general, the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite catalyst was due Energy Fuels to the formation of the direct Z-scheme system with higher redox potential for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 under visible-light irradiation.The stability analysis further confirms continuous fuel formation over entire irradiation time and employing multiple cycles without any decrement in productivity.The findings of the present work are expected to be utilized for constructing the Z-scheme heterojunction system without using noble metals with controlled morphology for tailoring photoinduced CO 2 reduction to fuels and which would also be helpful for other solar fuel application.
