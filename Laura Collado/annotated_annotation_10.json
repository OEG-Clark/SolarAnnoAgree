method.Titanium (IV) butoxide and polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight of 20,000, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were added to a 0.1 M nitric acid solution.The volume ratio of titanium butoxide to HNO 3 was 1:6, and the weight of PEG was 50 of that of TiO 2 .The appearance of pure TiO 2 solution was milky and slightly transparent.PEG was added to prevent cracking during the drying and calcination of the film.Furthermore, it tends to increase the viscosity of the solution as well as the uniformity TiO 2 particles dispersed in the solution.An appropriate amount of metal precursor, such as CuCl 2 or AgNO 3 , was added to obtain the desired metal loading of TiO 2 .The mixed solution was stirred and heated to 80 C for 8 h.Detailed preparation procedure was reported in literature 33. Optical fibers were obtained from the E-Tone Technology Company of Taiwan.The polymeric shield on the optical fiber was burned off in a furnace at 400 C.The remaining quartz fiber had a diameter of 112 lm.Each quartz fiber was cleaned by a 5 M NaOH solution in an ultrasonic cleaner, and then rinsed in de-ionized water and dried before applying dip-coating procedure.The bare fiber was immersed into the solution vertically, and then pulled up at various rates by a step motor.The pulling-up rates ranged from 5 to 50 mm/min.The TiO 2 coated optical fibers were dried in air at 150 C with a rate of 1 C/min from the ambient temperature, and maintained at 150 C for 3 h.Then it was calcined at 500 C for another 5 h.The TiO 2 film on optical fiber was durable and has passed the ''Cross-Cut tape test'', according to the methods described in ISO 2409 and ASTM D3359 34. Synthesis of TiO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxide was carried out in two steps 35.The two solutions were mixed and refluxed at 80 C for 1 h under vigorous stirring (ca.1,500 rpm).Acetyl acetone (acac, Merck) was employed as a chelating agent.The first solution consisted of corresponding volume of chelating agent in 15 mL of solvent (50 v/v of ethanol and isopropanol).The second one was Tetraisopropoxytitanium (TTIP, Merck) diluted in 35 mL of solvent.The resulted deep-yellow transparent liquid (when the acac as a chelating agent was used) or a colorless transparent liquid (without chelating agent) was cooled to ambient temperature for 1 h.The solution is denoted as modified TTIP. The hydrolysant (35 hydrochloric acid and the amount of de-ionized water used in 10 mL of solvent) was added to tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Merck) solution via a dropping funnel and vigorously stirred at 50 C for 45 min, which is referred to as the pre-hydrolysis of TEOS.After that, the modified TTIP as described above was added into the solution under vigorous stirring.After 10 min, the hydrolysis was completed by addition of the residual amount of de-ionized water diluted in 18 mL of solvent under vigorous stirring.Finally, 15 of mL solvent was introduced after another 10 min had elapsed. The molar ratio of alkoxides:water:hydrochloric acid: solvents was 1:4:0.19:5and the content of SiO 2 in TiO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxides was 5 wt.The sol-gel solution was aged for 24 h at room temperature and then dried in the oven at 80 C for 24 h.The resulting xerogel was calcined in static air at 500 C for 2 h. The molar ratio of 1 for acac/TTIP was employed to prepare TiO 2 -SiO 2 -acac sample.The sample prepared without using chelating agent was denoted as TiO 2 -SiO 2 .For the preparation of metal doped TiO 2 -SiO 2 , the same synthesis procedure for TiO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxide as described above was employed except that the corresponding metal salts were mixed with the derived TiO 2 -SiO 2 sol-gels after the sol-gel processes. Commercial titanium dioxide powder (P25, Degussa) was used as a TiO 2 source to prepare dye-sensitized photocatalysts.Cu(NO 3 ) 2 A 3H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 A 9H 2 O (Aldrich) were employed as precursors of metal dopants on P25 support.Ru II (2,2 0 -bipyridyl-4,4 0 -dicarboxylate) 2 -(NCS) 2 (also called N3-dye, Solaronix) was used as a dye sensitizer that was dissolved in ethanol (99.5) to obtain a 3 mM dye solution. P25 slurry with corresponding metal salts was prepared by adding aqueous PEG solution with the metal salts to P25 TiO2 fiber Fig. 2 The schematic of light transmission and spread of TiO 2 coated optical fiber powder in a mortar under vigorous grinding with pestle 36.The prepared uniform lump-free slurry was coated on optical fibers by dip-coating method.Dye-adsorbed photocatalyst was obtained by dipping the corresponding photocatalyst into the 3 mM dye solution for 24 h.Subsequently, dye-adsorbed photocatalyst was rinsed with ethanol (99.5) to obtain a monolayer of dye on the photocatalyst surface.The resulting dye-adsorbed photocatalyst was finally put in an oven at 80 C for 30 min to remove the residue solvent on the surface of the photocatalyst. An optical-fiber photoreactor (OFPR) was designed and assembled to transmit light to the fiber-supported TiO 2 film from one side of the OFPR module, as shown in Fig. 3.The fibers with length of nearly 11 cm long were inserted into the OFPR.The optical fibers were supported on circular plates with a diameter of 5.0 cm.The OFPR was irradiated by artificial light or concentrated natural sunlight through the quartz window at one side.The artificial light (320-500 nm) was supplied by Exfo Acticure 4,000 with a highest intensity at 365 nm using an appropriate color filter.The light intensity could be tuned and measured with a Lumen meter (Exfo).A solar concentrator (Himawari, Japan) was used to collect natural sunlight.The reflection dish of the solar concentrator is able to track the sun trajectory during a day so that the maximum sunlight intensity can be obtained.The concentrated sunlight is transmitted via an optical cable and focused on the window of the photoreactor.The reactor was wrapped with a heating tape connected to temperature controller with a thermocouple placed at the center of the reactor to maintain the reaction temperature.The reactor was purged by CO 2 gas bubbling through distilled water for 1 h before the reaction.The space velocity of CO 2 gas and H 2 O vapor was maintained at nearly 0.72 h -1 .The photo reactions were carried out at steady state and lasted for 6-24 h.Some reactions were repeated two or three times, and the deactivation of catalysts was found to be negligible.The outlet gases were analyzed by a GC equipped with FID and porapak Q column. The photoreduction of CO 2 on thermal-hydrolyzed TiO 2 was studied using diffusive reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) under UV irradiation.Zero-grade air, high-purity He and ultra-purity CO 2 (99.999 v), from Air Products (USA) were used in the IR system.In order to reduce water interference, air and He were passed through a moisture trapper before entering the photoreactor. A high-temperature chamber (HVC, Harrick HVC-DRP-1) made of 316 stainless steel was used as the photoreactor.There were three windows on the HVC dome.Two of them were KBr windows that were transparent to both IR and UV light for IR transmittance.The third one for UV irradiation was a quartz window that was transparent in the UV region but only partly transparent in the IR region.The photoreactor was located inside the compartment of the FTIR instrument.Pressure and gas flow rate were measured by a pressure transducer and a bubble flow meter, respectively.A K-type thermocouple and an electric heater were connected on the sample cup.A temperature controller, which was directly connected to the thermocouple and heater of the HVC, provided accurate temperature control (1 C).The HVC can be heated up to 600 C.The UV light source (EXFO, OmniCure 1000) was supplied by a 100 W Hg lamp with filter to give light with wavelength of 365 nm only.The UV light was led to the quartz window of the HVC by an optical cable.The detailed description of the system can be found in the literature 37.Clearly, TiO 2 film absorbs light of wavelength below 380 nm.The UV-visible absorption spectra of Cu/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 photocatalysts are similar to that of pure titania.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "CuCl2 or AgNO3", "source": "An appropriate amount of metal precursor, such as CuCl 2 or AgNO 3 , was added to obtain the desired metal loading of TiO 2 .", "context": "The TiO 2 solutions to be on optical fibers were prepared by the thermal hydrolysis method.Titanium (IV) butoxide and polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight of 20,000, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were added to a 0.1 M nitric acid solution.The volume ratio of titanium butoxide to HNO 3 was 1:6, and the weight of PEG was 50 of that of TiO 2 .The appearance of pure TiO 2 solution was milky and slightly transparent.PEG was added to prevent cracking during the drying and calcination of the film.Furthermore, it tends to increase the viscosity of the solution as well as the uniformity TiO 2 particles dispersed in the solution.An appropriate amount of metal precursor, such as CuCl 2 or AgNO 3 , was added to obtain the desired metal loading of TiO 2 .The mixed solution was stirred and heated to 80 C for 8 h.Detailed preparation procedure was reported in literature 33.

A high-temperature chamber (HVC, Harrick HVC-DRP-1) made of 316 stainless steel was used as the photoreactor.There were three windows on the HVC dome.Two of them were KBr windows that were transparent to both IR and UV light for IR transmittance.The third one for UV irradiation was a quartz window that was transparent in the UV region but only partly transparent in the IR region.The photoreactor was located inside the compartment of the FTIR instrument.Pressure and gas flow rate were measured by a pressure transducer and a bubble flow meter, respectively.A K-type thermocouple and an electric heater were connected on the sample cup.A temperature controller, which was directly connected to the thermocouple and heater of the HVC, provided accurate temperature control (1 C).The HVC can be heated up to 600 C.The UV light source (EXFO, OmniCure 1000) was supplied by a 100 W Hg lamp with filter to give light with wavelength of 365 nm only.The UV light was led to the quartz window of the HVC by an optical cable.The detailed description of the system can be found in the literature 37.Clearly, TiO 2 film absorbs light of wavelength below 380 nm.The UV-visible absorption spectra of Cu/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 photocatalysts are similar to that of pure titania.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Ru II (2,2 0 -bipyridyl-4,4 0 -dicarboxylate) 2 -(NCS) 2 (also called N3-dye, Solaronix)", "source": "Ru II (2,2 0 -bipyridyl-4,4 0 -dicarboxylate) 2 -(NCS) 2 (also called N3-dye, Solaronix) was used as a dye sensitizer that was dissolved in ethanol (99.5) to obtain a 3 mM dye solution.", "context": "The TiO 2 solutions to be on optical fibers were prepared by the thermal hydrolysis method.Titanium (IV) butoxide and polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight of 20,000, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were added to a 0.1 M nitric acid solution.The volume ratio of titanium butoxide to HNO 3 was 1:6, and the weight of PEG was 50 of that of TiO 2 .The appearance of pure TiO 2 solution was milky and slightly transparent.PEG was added to prevent cracking during the drying and calcination of the film.Furthermore, it tends to increase the viscosity of the solution as well as the uniformity TiO 2 particles dispersed in the solution.An appropriate amount of metal precursor, such as CuCl 2 or AgNO 3 , was added to obtain the desired metal loading of TiO 2 .The mixed solution was stirred and heated to 80 C for 8 h.Detailed preparation procedure was reported in literature 33. Optical fibers were obtained from the E-Tone Technology Company of Taiwan.The polymeric shield on the optical fiber was burned off in a furnace at 400 C.The remaining quartz fiber had a diameter of 112 lm.Each quartz fiber was cleaned by a 5 M NaOH solution in an ultrasonic cleaner, and then rinsed in de-ionized water and dried before applying dip-coating procedure.The bare fiber was immersed into the solution vertically, and then pulled up at various rates by a step motor.The pulling-up rates ranged from 5 to 50 mm/min.The TiO 2 coated optical fibers were dried in air at 150 C with a rate of 1 C/min from the ambient temperature, and maintained at 150 C for 3 h.Then it was calcined at 500 C for another 5 h.The TiO 2 film on optical fiber was durable and has passed the ''Cross-Cut tape test'', according to the methods described in ISO 2409 and ASTM D3359 34. Synthesis of TiO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxide was carried out in two steps 35.The two solutions were mixed and refluxed at 80 C for 1 h under vigorous stirring (ca.1,500 rpm).Acetyl acetone (acac, Merck) was employed as a chelating agent.The first solution consisted of corresponding volume of chelating agent in 15 mL of solvent (50 v/v of ethanol and isopropanol).The second one was Tetraisopropoxytitanium (TTIP, Merck) diluted in 35 mL of solvent.The resulted deep-yellow transparent liquid (when the acac as a chelating agent was used) or a colorless transparent liquid (without chelating agent) was cooled to ambient temperature for 1 h.The solution is denoted as modified TTIP.

Optical fibers were obtained from the E-Tone Technology Company of Taiwan.The polymeric shield on the optical fiber was burned off in a furnace at 400 C.The remaining quartz fiber had a diameter of 112 lm.Each quartz fiber was cleaned by a 5 M NaOH solution in an ultrasonic cleaner, and then rinsed in de-ionized water and dried before applying dip-coating procedure.The bare fiber was immersed into the solution vertically, and then pulled up at various rates by a step motor.The pulling-up rates ranged from 5 to 50 mm/min.The TiO 2 coated optical fibers were dried in air at 150 C with a rate of 1 C/min from the ambient temperature, and maintained at 150 C for 3 h.Then it was calcined at 500 C for another 5 h.The TiO 2 film on optical fiber was durable and has passed the ''Cross-Cut tape test'', according to the methods described in ISO 2409 and ASTM D3359 34. Synthesis of TiO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxide was carried out in two steps 35.The two solutions were mixed and refluxed at 80 C for 1 h under vigorous stirring (ca.1,500 rpm).Acetyl acetone (acac, Merck) was employed as a chelating agent.The first solution consisted of corresponding volume of chelating agent in 15 mL of solvent (50 v/v of ethanol and isopropanol).The second one was Tetraisopropoxytitanium (TTIP, Merck) diluted in 35 mL of solvent.The resulted deep-yellow transparent liquid (when the acac as a chelating agent was used) or a colorless transparent liquid (without chelating agent) was cooled to ambient temperature for 1 h.The solution is denoted as modified TTIP.

The molar ratio of alkoxides:water:hydrochloric acid: solvents was 1:4:0.19:5and the content of SiO 2 in TiO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxides was 5 wt.The sol-gel solution was aged for 24 h at room temperature and then dried in the oven at 80 C for 24 h.The resulting xerogel was calcined in static air at 500 C for 2 h.

P25 slurry with corresponding metal salts was prepared by adding aqueous PEG solution with the metal salts to P25 TiO2 fiber Fig. 2 The schematic of light transmission and spread of TiO 2 coated optical fiber powder in a mortar under vigorous grinding with pestle 36.The prepared uniform lump-free slurry was coated on optical fibers by dip-coating method.Dye-adsorbed photocatalyst was obtained by dipping the corresponding photocatalyst into the 3 mM dye solution for 24 h.Subsequently, dye-adsorbed photocatalyst was rinsed with ethanol (99.5) to obtain a monolayer of dye on the photocatalyst surface.The resulting dye-adsorbed photocatalyst was finally put in an oven at 80 C for 30 min to remove the residue solvent on the surface of the photocatalyst. An optical-fiber photoreactor (OFPR) was designed and assembled to transmit light to the fiber-supported TiO 2 film from one side of the OFPR module, as shown in Fig. 3.The fibers with length of nearly 11 cm long were inserted into the OFPR.The optical fibers were supported on circular plates with a diameter of 5.0 cm.The OFPR was irradiated by artificial light or concentrated natural sunlight through the quartz window at one side.The artificial light (320-500 nm) was supplied by Exfo Acticure 4,000 with a highest intensity at 365 nm using an appropriate color filter.The light intensity could be tuned and measured with a Lumen meter (Exfo).A solar concentrator (Himawari, Japan) was used to collect natural sunlight.The reflection dish of the solar concentrator is able to track the sun trajectory during a day so that the maximum sunlight intensity can be obtained.The concentrated sunlight is transmitted via an optical cable and focused on the window of the photoreactor.The reactor was wrapped with a heating tape connected to temperature controller with a thermocouple placed at the center of the reactor to maintain the reaction temperature.The reactor was purged by CO 2 gas bubbling through distilled water for 1 h before the reaction.The space velocity of CO 2 gas and H 2 O vapor was maintained at nearly 0.72 h -1 .The photo reactions were carried out at steady state and lasted for 6-24 h.Some reactions were repeated two or three times, and the deactivation of catalysts was found to be negligible.The outlet gases were analyzed by a GC equipped with FID and porapak Q column. The photoreduction of CO 2 on thermal-hydrolyzed TiO 2 was studied using diffusive reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) under UV irradiation.Zero-grade air, high-purity He and ultra-purity CO 2 (99.999 v), from Air Products (USA) were used in the IR system.In order to reduce water interference, air and He were passed through a moisture trapper before entering the photoreactor. A high-temperature chamber (HVC, Harrick HVC-DRP-1) made of 316 stainless steel was used as the photoreactor.There were three windows on the HVC dome.Two of them were KBr windows that were transparent to both IR and UV light for IR transmittance.The third one for UV irradiation was a quartz window that was transparent in the UV region but only partly transparent in the IR region.The photoreactor was located inside the compartment of the FTIR instrument.Pressure and gas flow rate were measured by a pressure transducer and a bubble flow meter, respectively.A K-type thermocouple and an electric heater were connected on the sample cup.A temperature controller, which was directly connected to the thermocouple and heater of the HVC, provided accurate temperature control (1 C).The HVC can be heated up to 600 C.The UV light source (EXFO, OmniCure 1000) was supplied by a 100 W Hg lamp with filter to give light with wavelength of 365 nm only.The UV light was led to the quartz window of the HVC by an optical cable.The detailed description of the system can be found in the literature 37.Clearly, TiO 2 film absorbs light of wavelength below 380 nm.The UV-visible absorption spectra of Cu/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 photocatalysts are similar to that of pure titania.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "An optical-fiber photoreactor has been designed and applied to the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O using TiO 2 , Cu/TiO 2 , Ag/TiO 2 , Cu-Fe/TiO 2 -SiO 2 and dye-sensitized Cu-Fe/P25 coated optical fibers.", "context": "An optical-fiber photoreactor has been designed and applied to the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O using TiO 2 , Cu/TiO 2 , Ag/TiO 2 , Cu-Fe/TiO 2 -SiO 2 and dye-sensitized Cu-Fe/P25 coated optical fibers.The photoreduction of CO 2 is one of the best routes to realize renewable energy similar to photosynthesis.Compared with a traditional packed-bed reactor, an optical fiber provides a medium to transmit light uniformly throughout a reactor.In addition, a higher processing capacity is possible because the photocatalyst can be disperse on the optical fibers with large surface area in a given reactor volume.The advantage of photo-driven reaction is clearly benefited from the unlimited solar energy.However, further improvement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is still needed.

An optical-fiber photoreactor (OFPR) was designed and assembled to transmit light to the fiber-supported TiO 2 film from one side of the OFPR module, as shown in Fig. 3.The fibers with length of nearly 11 cm long were inserted into the OFPR.The optical fibers were supported on circular plates with a diameter of 5.0 cm.The OFPR was irradiated by artificial light or concentrated natural sunlight through the quartz window at one side.The artificial light (320-500 nm) was supplied by Exfo Acticure 4,000 with a highest intensity at 365 nm using an appropriate color filter.The light intensity could be tuned and measured with a Lumen meter (Exfo).A solar concentrator (Himawari, Japan) was used to collect natural sunlight.The reflection dish of the solar concentrator is able to track the sun trajectory during a day so that the maximum sunlight intensity can be obtained.The concentrated sunlight is transmitted via an optical cable and focused on the window of the photoreactor.The reactor was wrapped with a heating tape connected to temperature controller with a thermocouple placed at the center of the reactor to maintain the reaction temperature.The reactor was purged by CO 2 gas bubbling through distilled water for 1 h before the reaction.The space velocity of CO 2 gas and H 2 O vapor was maintained at nearly 0.72 h -1 .The photo reactions were carried out at steady state and lasted for 6-24 h.Some reactions were repeated two or three times, and the deactivation of catalysts was found to be negligible.The outlet gases were analyzed by a GC equipped with FID and porapak Q column. The photoreduction of CO 2 on thermal-hydrolyzed TiO 2 was studied using diffusive reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) under UV irradiation.Zero-grade air, high-purity He and ultra-purity CO 2 (99.999 v), from Air Products (USA) were used in the IR system.In order to reduce water interference, air and He were passed through a moisture trapper before entering the photoreactor. A high-temperature chamber (HVC, Harrick HVC-DRP-1) made of 316 stainless steel was used as the photoreactor.There were three windows on the HVC dome.Two of them were KBr windows that were transparent to both IR and UV light for IR transmittance.The third one for UV irradiation was a quartz window that was transparent in the UV region but only partly transparent in the IR region.The photoreactor was located inside the compartment of the FTIR instrument.Pressure and gas flow rate were measured by a pressure transducer and a bubble flow meter, respectively.A K-type thermocouple and an electric heater were connected on the sample cup.A temperature controller, which was directly connected to the thermocouple and heater of the HVC, provided accurate temperature control (1 C).The HVC can be heated up to 600 C.The UV light source (EXFO, OmniCure 1000) was supplied by a 100 W Hg lamp with filter to give light with wavelength of 365 nm only.The UV light was led to the quartz window of the HVC by an optical cable.The detailed description of the system can be found in the literature 37.Clearly, TiO 2 film absorbs light of wavelength below 380 nm.The UV-visible absorption spectra of Cu/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 photocatalysts are similar to that of pure titania.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "Not mentioned in the text", "context": "An optical-fiber photoreactor has been designed and applied to the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O using TiO 2 , Cu/TiO 2 , Ag/TiO 2 , Cu-Fe/TiO 2 -SiO 2 and dye-sensitized Cu-Fe/P25 coated optical fibers.The photoreduction of CO 2 is one of the best routes to realize renewable energy similar to photosynthesis.Compared with a traditional packed-bed reactor, an optical fiber provides a medium to transmit light uniformly throughout a reactor.In addition, a higher processing capacity is possible because the photocatalyst can be disperse on the optical fibers with large surface area in a given reactor volume.The advantage of photo-driven reaction is clearly benefited from the unlimited solar energy.However, further improvement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is still needed.
