hydrothermal and an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method.In the first step, TiO 2 in pure anatase, anatase/brookite mixture, or pure brookite phase was prepared by a hydrothermal method.To prepare pure anatase TiO 2 , 10 ml of a titanium bis (ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH) aqueous solution (50) and a 0.1 M urea solution were mixed, followed by the addition of distilled water to reach a final volume of 100 ml.The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and placed in an electric oven held at 160 C for 24 h.Then, the autoclave was naturally cooled in air.The precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water until pH 7. The obtained TiO 2 nanoparticle suspension was the precursor for Ag/TiO 2 microspheres in the next step.To prepare mixed anatase/brookite and pure brookite TiO 2 , a similar procedure was performed but the concentration of urea in the precursor solution was changed to 0.5 and 7 M, respectively.Increasing the urea concentration favors the production of brookite content. In the second step, Ag/TiO 2 composite microspheres were prepared by an USP process, similar to that reported in our previous study 5.The spraying solution was prepared by mixing an aqueous AgNO 3 solution and TiO 2 nanoparticle suspensions and sonicating for 30 min.The mixture was fed to an ultrasonic nebulizer (Sonaer) that has a frequency of 2.4 MHz and produces droplets with a volumetric mean diameter of 1.8 m.The generated fine mists containing AgNO 3 /TiO 2 were carried out by nitrogen gas and passed through a diffusion dryer composed of silica gels to dry out the mists.The aerosols subsequently passed through a cylindrical quartz tube that was placed inside a tube furnace (Thermo Fisher) with a set temperature of 500 C. The spray-pyrolyzed particles were collected on a glass fiber filter placed inside a stainless-steel filter holder.The resulting powder was finally calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air to form the Ag/TiO 2 composites. The as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 surfaces were identified to be rich in Ag(I) species, as reported in a later section of the paper.To prepare Ag(0)/TiO 2 , the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 was photoreduced in situ for 45 min under UV-vis light irradiation.Different from the conventional photo-deposition method (operated in an aqueous solution where Ag is reduced to Ag 0 ), the in situ photoreduction of Ag(I) in this work was conducted at a solid-gas interface just prior to the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction in the same reactor used for CO 2 photoreduction.A stream of helium (10 ml/min) as a carrier gas was bubbled through a water/methanol bath and passed through the Ag/TiO 2 surface, where Ag(I) could be reduced to Ag(0) under UV-vis irradiation with methanol vapor acting as the reducing agent.This novel in situ reduction method could avoid the re-oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I) in an air environment when a conventional ex situ photo-deposition method was used.The untreated and treated (in situ photoreduced) Ag/TiO 2 catalysts were denoted as Ag(I)/Ti(M) and Ag(0)/Ti(M), respectively, where M A, AB, BA, or P25, representing the crystal phase of TiO 2 (A: anatase, AB: anatase-rich anatase/brookite mixture, BA: brookite-rich anatase/brookite mixture, P25: anatase/rutile with 75/25 phase ratio). In comparison with the above mentioned sequential spray pyrolysis and an in situ photoreduction method (abbreviated as SP method), two other methods, photo-deposition (PD) and wetimpregnation (WI) were used as controls.In the photo-deposition method, TiO 2 microspheres were first made by the USP process and then immersed in a Ag(NO 3 ) solution under UV irradiation where Ag(0) nanoparticles were expected to form and deposit on the TiO 2 surface.The in situ photoreduction process was not performed for the PD sample.In the wet-impregnation method, TiO 2 nanoparticles were mixed with a Ag(NO 3 ) solution and directly calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air without undergoing the USP process, and thus the WI sample did not have the porous spherical structure.The WI sample was subject to the in situ photoreduction process before CO 2 photocatalytic reaction was conducted.The three types of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) catalysts prepared by the SP, PD, and WI methods were denoted as Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI, respectively. The crystal structures of the Ag/TiO 2 samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Scintag XDS 2000) using Cu K irradiation at 45 kV, and a diffracted beam monochromator at 40 mA.Raman spectroscopy was carried out with a Renishaw 1000B system in the range of 100-700 cm -1 .The surface area, pore size and pore volume of Ag/TiO 2 were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 77 K using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).The optical properties were examined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using a UV-vis spectrometer (Ocean Optics) with BaSO 4 as the background.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S4800) was used to investigate the catalyst morphology.The dispersion of elements (Ag, Ti, O) on Ag/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was conducted to measure the surface concentration of Ag. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption was conducted to probe the Ag valence on Ag/TiO 2 , using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Electron) and a DRIFTS accessory (Praying Mantis).The dome of the DRIFTS cell has two KBr windows allowing IR transmission and a third (quartz) window allowing transmission of irradiation introduced through a liquid light guide (Newport) that connects to a 450 W Xe arc system (Oriel).Details of the DRIFTS setup can be found in our previous work 11.In situ DRIFTS spectra of the CO interaction with Ag/TiO 2 were recorded for both unpretreated and in situ photoreduced samples.For the unpretreated sample, Ag(I)/Ti(P25), the background spectrum in the presence of the sample was collected after purging with an ample amount of He. 5 CO balanced in He (99.999,Praxair) was then continuously introduced into the chamber at 4.0 mL/min for 20 min, and the IR spectra were recorded with time.For the photoreduced sample, Ag(0)/Ti(P25), the IR spectra were collected after Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was photoreduced in situ by bubbling a He H 2 O/CH 3 OH mixture to the DRIFTS cell under UV-vis irradiation for 45 min. The experiments of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor in the presence of gas-phase CH 3 OH (a hole scavenger) were carried out in a setup similar to that reported in our previous study 5.For each test, 30 mg of catalysts were used and dispersed on a glass fiber inside the reactor.CO 2 continuously passed through a bubbler to bring a mixed gas of CO 2 /H 2 O/CH 3 OH (97.1/2.3/0.6 volume ratio) into the reactor at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min.A 150 W solar simulator (Oriel) was used as the light source, with a light intensity of about 90 mW/cm 2 in the range of 200-900 nm.The gaseous products in the reactor effluent were continuously analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).The photocatalytic activity of each catalyst was measured three times using different batches of samples and the average values and standard deviations were reported.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "This work has investigated the effects of a TiO 2 crystal phase, an Ag valence, and a preparation method on the photocatalytic performance of Ag/TiO 2 composites for CO 2 photoreduction with water in the presence of methanol.", "context": "This work has investigated the effects of a TiO 2 crystal phase, an Ag valence, and a preparation method on the photocatalytic performance of Ag/TiO 2 composites for CO 2 photoreduction with water in the presence of methanol.The material property analysis and photocatalytic activity results demonstrated that anatase-rich anatase/brookite (AB) mixed-phase TiO 2 is an excellent photocatalyst that exhibited higher activity than pure anatase, a brookite-rich anatase/brookite mixture, and anatase/rutile (P25).The interfacial charge transfer between anatase and brookite is believed to play an important role to enhance the catalytic activity.Ag(0)-incorporated TiO 2 (AB) was more active than Ag(I)-incorporated TiO 2 (AB), indicating the importance of ensuring the right Ag valence on the catalyst surface.This study also presented a novel and effective method to disperse Ag(0) uniformly on the TiO 2 surface, i.e., the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction process (SP method).This SP method is much superior to the conventional ex situ photodeposition (PD) and wet-impregnation (WI) process, as evidenced by one order of magnitude higher production of H 2 and CH 4 .Although this work has suggested that the interfaces between TiO 2 anatase and brookite as well as those between Ag(0) and TiO 2 are critical for enhanced CO 2 photoreduction, the exact charge transfer mechanism is not well understood.Future work is necessary to explore the mechanism in a systematic manner by applying spectroscopic analysis (such as FTIR and EPR) and correlating with material properties and photocatalytic activities.

The experiments of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor in the presence of gas-phase CH 3 OH (a hole scavenger) were carried out in a setup similar to that reported in our previous study 5.For each test, 30 mg of catalysts were used and dispersed on a glass fiber inside the reactor.CO 2 continuously passed through a bubbler to bring a mixed gas of CO 2 /H 2 O/CH 3 OH (97.1/2.3/0.6 volume ratio) into the reactor at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min.A 150 W solar simulator (Oriel) was used as the light source, with a light intensity of about 90 mW/cm 2 in the range of 200-900 nm.The gaseous products in the reactor effluent were continuously analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).The photocatalytic activity of each catalyst was measured three times using different batches of samples and the average values and standard deviations were reported.", "vote": "1"}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "For each test, 30 mg of catalysts were used and dispersed on a glass fiber inside the reactor.", "context": "Ag/TiO 2 composite microspheres were prepared by combining a hydrothermal and an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method.In the first step, TiO 2 in pure anatase, anatase/brookite mixture, or pure brookite phase was prepared by a hydrothermal method.To prepare pure anatase TiO 2 , 10 ml of a titanium bis (ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH) aqueous solution (50) and a 0.1 M urea solution were mixed, followed by the addition of distilled water to reach a final volume of 100 ml.The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and placed in an electric oven held at 160 C for 24 h.Then, the autoclave was naturally cooled in air.The precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water until pH 7. The obtained TiO 2 nanoparticle suspension was the precursor for Ag/TiO 2 microspheres in the next step.To prepare mixed anatase/brookite and pure brookite TiO 2 , a similar procedure was performed but the concentration of urea in the precursor solution was changed to 0.5 and 7 M, respectively.Increasing the urea concentration favors the production of brookite content. In the second step, Ag/TiO 2 composite microspheres were prepared by an USP process, similar to that reported in our previous study 5.The spraying solution was prepared by mixing an aqueous AgNO 3 solution and TiO 2 nanoparticle suspensions and sonicating for 30 min.The mixture was fed to an ultrasonic nebulizer (Sonaer) that has a frequency of 2.4 MHz and produces droplets with a volumetric mean diameter of 1.8 m.The generated fine mists containing AgNO 3 /TiO 2 were carried out by nitrogen gas and passed through a diffusion dryer composed of silica gels to dry out the mists.The aerosols subsequently passed through a cylindrical quartz tube that was placed inside a tube furnace (Thermo Fisher) with a set temperature of 500 C. The spray-pyrolyzed particles were collected on a glass fiber filter placed inside a stainless-steel filter holder.The resulting powder was finally calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air to form the Ag/TiO 2 composites. The as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 surfaces were identified to be rich in Ag(I) species, as reported in a later section of the paper.To prepare Ag(0)/TiO 2 , the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 was photoreduced in situ for 45 min under UV-vis light irradiation.Different from the conventional photo-deposition method (operated in an aqueous solution where Ag is reduced to Ag 0 ), the in situ photoreduction of Ag(I) in this work was conducted at a solid-gas interface just prior to the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction in the same reactor used for CO 2 photoreduction.A stream of helium (10 ml/min) as a carrier gas was bubbled through a water/methanol bath and passed through the Ag/TiO 2 surface, where Ag(I) could be reduced to Ag(0) under UV-vis irradiation with methanol vapor acting as the reducing agent.This novel in situ reduction method could avoid the re-oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I) in an air environment when a conventional ex situ photo-deposition method was used.The untreated and treated (in situ photoreduced) Ag/TiO 2 catalysts were denoted as Ag(I)/Ti(M) and Ag(0)/Ti(M), respectively, where M A, AB, BA, or P25, representing the crystal phase of TiO 2 (A: anatase, AB: anatase-rich anatase/brookite mixture, BA: brookite-rich anatase/brookite mixture, P25: anatase/rutile with 75/25 phase ratio). In comparison with the above mentioned sequential spray pyrolysis and an in situ photoreduction method (abbreviated as SP method), two other methods, photo-deposition (PD) and wetimpregnation (WI) were used as controls.In the photo-deposition method, TiO 2 microspheres were first made by the USP process and then immersed in a Ag(NO 3 ) solution under UV irradiation where Ag(0) nanoparticles were expected to form and deposit on the TiO 2 surface.The in situ photoreduction process was not performed for the PD sample.In the wet-impregnation method, TiO 2 nanoparticles were mixed with a Ag(NO 3 ) solution and directly calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air without undergoing the USP process, and thus the WI sample did not have the porous spherical structure.The WI sample was subject to the in situ photoreduction process before CO 2 photocatalytic reaction was conducted.The three types of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) catalysts prepared by the SP, PD, and WI methods were denoted as Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI, respectively.
