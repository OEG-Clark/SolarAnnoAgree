Due to the composite effect of Vo and protonation in the Sscheme system, the optimized p-C 3 N 4 /InVO 4 hetero-nanosheet displays dramatically boosted photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with a CO production rate of 14.05 mol g -1 h -1 , 6.03 and 3.23 times higher than that of bare InVO 4 and p-C 3 N 4 , respectively.This work provides new platforms for the development of efficient photocatalysts by integrated refining of structure defects and surface modification in constructing heterostructures.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "InVO4", "source": "The addition amount of C 3 N 4 was set as 0, 30, 50, and 70 mg, the obtained sample was named as InVO 4 (x 0) and p-C 3 N 4 /InVO 4 -x (x 3, 5, and 7, respectively).", "context": "The precursor was synthesized via a modified hydrothermal method 40,41.500 mg of melamine and 320 L of phosphorous acid were dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water at C in a thermostatic water bath with vigorous magnetic stirring for h.The resulting solution was then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 180 C for 10 h.After cooled down to room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water several times until the pH value of the solution reaches 7, and dried at 60 C in an oven.The mass of the obtained sample was mg.

Photocatalytic CO 2 RR was performed on an automatic photocatalytic reaction system (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight) using a Xeon lamp (Microsolar 300, Beijing Perfectlight) with a 420 nm cut-on filter as the visible-light source.Before photocatalytic tests, the asprepared photocatalyst (15 mg) was dispersed in 2 mL of distilled water and ultrasound for several minutes to form a homogeneous mixture, which was then slowly dropped on a fiberglass paper with an area of 12.56 cm 2 and naturally dried at room temperature.Subsequently, the fiberglass paper was put in a glass vessel (a volume of mL) containing 5 mL of deionized water.After that, the vessel was sealed with a quartz glass top, degassed to remove air, and filled with highpurity CO 2 (99.999).The temperature of the entire reaction system was kept at 25 C by cyclic condensed water.The generated gas from the reactor was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph GC-2014, Ar carrier).Isotope-labeling experiments were conducted under identical test conditions except using 13 CO instead of 12 CO 2 .0.1 mL of the gas product was withdrawn using a gastight syringe for gas analysis.The Agilent Technologies 6890 N network GC system combined with an Agilent Technologies 5975B inert XL MSD model mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was employed to collect the mass spectrometry data.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of S-scheme photocatalytic CO evolution was calculated using the following equation: the number of reacted electrons the number of incident photons Where n co represents the mole number of evolved CO; N A is the Avogadro constant; h is the Planck constant;, W, A, and t are the incident light frequency, intensity, irradiation area, and time, respectively. The Mott-Schottky experiment was conducted on Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Germany) with a standard threeelectrode system, where Hg/HgO (saturated NaOH) and Pt wire were utilized as reference and counter electrode, respectively.The photocatalyst-coated glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode with 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as electrolyte.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out in the three-electrode system by applying an ac voltage of 10 mV with frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz and the aqueous solutions of K 3 Fe(CN) 6 (5 mM) and KCl (1 M) as electrolyte.The photocurrent measurement was performed on an electrochemical station (CHI 660E, China), the procedure was similar to the EIS measurement except using photocatalyst-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as a working electrode.The working electrode was prepared by dropping 8 L of photocatalyst-containing suspension (5 mg of photocatalyst powders was dispersed in a mixture of ethylene glycol (30 L), ethanol (50 L), and Nafion (10 L)) on the surface of FTO with 1.5 1 cm 2 areas, and dried at 50 C in an oven. Periodic DFT-based method with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh of functional was applied for all of the calculations in this study using the Vienna ab initio simulation package 4344454647.During the calculations the valence electrons for V, In, O, C, and N atoms were set to p 6 d 4 s 1 , s 2 p 1 , s 2 p 4 , s 2 p 2 , s 2 p 3 , respectively.The DFT calculations were performed for the crystals, with a cutoff energy of 500 eV.The k-point Monkhorst-Pack grid of 9 6 8 was applied for the calculation of the bulk, giving rise to lattice parameters of a 5.81, b 8.58, and c 6.68 A, in good agreement with experiments 38.Then, a supercell of 2 1 1 was applied for the calculations of the electronic properties of InVO 4 material.Two different Vo were considered for the InVO 4 to evaluate the effect of Vo on electronic structures.For the density of states (DOS) calculations, the k-point grid was set to 9 12 15.The optimization of the 2 2 unit cells for the buckled C 3 N 4 was performed using a k-point of 3 3 1, which was increased to 8 8 1 for the DOS calculations.The optimized lattice parameters for the buckled C 3 N 4 are a b 6.93 A, well agreement with the previous DFT calculations 48.The vacuum was set to 20 A for the C 3 N 4 calculations. To understand the effect of protonation of C 3 N 4 on CO 2 hydrogenation, two hydrogen atoms were added to the C 3 N 4 sheet and the most stable structure was denoted as pristine C 3 N 4 .Gibbs free energy was calculated for each state in the reaction pathways of CO 2 hydrogenation using pristine C 3 N 4 and p-C 3 N 4 models.The key elementary reaction steps for CO 2 hydrogenation on the two models are given by:", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "visible-light", "source": "Fig. 6.Identification of dominated free radicals produced in (a) methanol and (b) aqueous suspension of the p-C 3 N 4 /InVO 4 -5, p-C 3 N 4 , and InVO 4 after 5 min of visible-light illumination.", "context": "In summary, we have successfully synthesized an S-scheme p-C 3 N 4 / InVO 4 hetero-nanosheet with tunable Vo via in-situ growth of InVO 4 nanobelts on p-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with the assistance of dilute HNO 3 for efficient CO 2 photoconversion.The HNO 3 not only provides H sources for p-C 3 N 4 , but also assists the growth of InVO 4 nanobelts on p-C 3 N 4 and the formation of Vo in InVO 4 .The Vo content is tuned by varying the C 3 N 4 amount, which reduces the free H concentration and increases the electron density around V in VO 4 3-, leading to a tade-off effect on Vo formation and thus a volcano-shaped evolution profile of Vo content.The optimized p-C 3 N 4 /InVO 4 -5 with abundant Vo possesses the highest photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity, delivering a CO production rate of 14.05 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 6.03 and 3.23 times higher than that of bare InVO 4 and p-C 3 N 4 , respectively.The boosted photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the composite effect of Vo and protonation of C 3 N 4 in the Sscheme system.Vo creates a defect state below the Fermi level, which reduces E g for broad visible-light harvesting, enhances the n-type conductivity of InVO 4 and the S-scheme charge transfer.Besides, the protonation of C 3 N 4 not only improves the electrical conductivity for charge transfer to adsorbed CO 2 molecules, but also reduces the formation energy barrier of reaction intermediates of CO 2 to CO.This work provides a new platform for the improvement of photocatalytic activity via integrated engineering of bulk defects and surface catalytic sites.

Composition and chemical states The composition and chemical state of samples are further investigated by XPS.The survey XPS spectrum of p-C 3 N 4 /InVO 4 -5 confirms the existence of In, V, O, C, and N elements without impurity elements detected (Fig. S7).To reveal electronic interactions in p-C 3 N 4 /InVO 4 , the comparison of high-resolution XPS spectra of In 3d, V 2p, and O 1s between bare InVO 4 and p-C 3 N 4 /InVO 4 -5 is made.For bare InVO 4 , the In 3d spectrum depicts two symmetry peaks located at 445.14 and 452.69 eV with splitting energy of 7.55 eV, corresponding to In 3d 5/2 and In 3d 3/2 of In 3 (Fig. Fig. 2.
