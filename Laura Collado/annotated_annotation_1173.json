The Transient photocurrent analysis, Nyquist plots and Mott-Schotty plots were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660B) with a standard three-electrode configuration.The typical working electrode preparation was as follows: 10 mg of powder sample and 5 mg of PVP are dispersed into a mixed solution of 1 mL of ethanol and 20 L of oleic acid, and then was ultrasonicated for 20 min to obtain a uniform suspension.Then, 40 L of suspension was deposited on the FTO glass substrate, and the coated area was 11 cm 2 .Finally, the coated FTO glass was dried at 80 C. The counter and the reference electrodes were Pt wire and Ag/AgCl, respectively.With 300 W Xe arc lamp ( 400 nm) as the light source, the photocurrent response was performed in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The Mott-Schottky plots was obtained in Impedance-Potential mode at fixed frequencies of 500, 800 and 1000 Hz.The potential range was from -1.6 to -0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and the scan rate was 50 mV/s.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM Fe(CN) 6 3-/Fe(CN) 6 4-.EIS was measured in frequency range between 10 -2 and 10 -6 Hz at 0.3 V.

LDH/N v -CN, M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and C-N v -CN for CO 2 reduction was investigated under the same conditions (Fig.5d).The morphologies of MgO/N v -CN, Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN, MgO-Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDH/N v -CN, M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and C-N v -CN were shown in FigureS2, similar to N v -CN nanosheets, which may be attributed to the low oxide loading.As shown in Fig.5d, the CO 2 reduction activity of Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN was significantly lower than that of N v -CN, indicating that Al-O bond were not the adsorption and activation sites for CO 2 .In contrast, MgO/N v -CN showed a high photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity, demonstrating that MgO was the active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and activation.Meanwhile, the activity of MgO-Al 2 O 3 / N v -CN was slightly lower than that of MgO/N v -CN, further demonstrating that Al-O bond was unfavorable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The activity of MgAl LDO/N v -CN was much higher than that of MgO/N v -CN, which may be related to the synergistic effect of MgO and Al 2 O 3 in MgAl LDO.In particular, the low-coordinated O 2-in Mg-O can promote the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , and the coordinated unsaturated AI 3 can promote the adsorption and dissociation of H 2 O, while this effect is only present in MgAl LDO and not in the mixed oxides of MgO and Al 2 O 3 .To understand the relationship between MgAl LDO and N v -CN, the CO 2 reduction activities of 10 MgAl LDH/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and physically mixed MgAl LDO and N v -CN (M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN) were compared under the same conditions.The MgAl LDH/N v -CN exhibited a higher activity than N v -CN, which may be due to the formation of a heterojunction structure between MgAl LDH and N v -CN.The M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN was much less active than N v -CN, suggesting that a tight contact between MgAl LDO and N v -CN must exist to achieve efficient CO 2 reduction.Compared with CN, the CO 2 reduction activity of 10 MgAl LDO/CN was increased, which was caused by the enhanced CO 2 adsorption from the surface Lewis base of MgAl LDO.However, the CO 2 reduction activity of 10 MgAl LDO/CN was much lower than that of 10 MgAl LDO/N v -CN, probably because MgAl LDO is an adsorption site rather than a catalytic site for the CO 2 reduction reaction.Therefore, it is hypothesized that the enhanced MgAl LDO/N v -CN activity should result from the multiple synergistic effects of the nitrogen defect and MgAl LDO.Furthermore, C-N v -CN was obtained without the addition of MgAl LDH during the synthesis of MgAl LDO/N v -CN, and the activity of C-N v -CN for the reduction of CO 2 did not change significantly compared to that of N v -CN, indicating that the synergistic effect of MgAl LDO and nitrogen defects in MgAl LDO/N v -CN is the main factor causing the increased activity of N v -CN.

The Transient photocurrent analysis, Nyquist plots and Mott-Schotty plots were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660B) with a standard three-electrode configuration.The typical working electrode preparation was as follows: 10 mg of powder sample and 5 mg of PVP are dispersed into a mixed solution of 1 mL of ethanol and 20 L of oleic acid, and then was ultrasonicated for 20 min to obtain a uniform suspension.Then, 40 L of suspension was deposited on the FTO glass substrate, and the coated area was 11 cm 2 .Finally, the coated FTO glass was dried at 80 C. The counter and the reference electrodes were Pt wire and Ag/AgCl, respectively.With 300 W Xe arc lamp ( 400 nm) as the light source, the photocurrent response was performed in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The Mott-Schottky plots was obtained in Impedance-Potential mode at fixed frequencies of 500, 800 and 1000 Hz.The potential range was from -1.6 to -0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and the scan rate was 50 mV/s.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM Fe(CN) 6 3-/Fe(CN) 6 4-.EIS was measured in frequency range between 10 -2 and 10 -6 Hz at 0.3 V.

LDH/N v -CN, M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and C-N v -CN for CO 2 reduction was investigated under the same conditions (Fig.5d).The morphologies of MgO/N v -CN, Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN, MgO-Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDH/N v -CN, M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and C-N v -CN were shown in FigureS2, similar to N v -CN nanosheets, which may be attributed to the low oxide loading.As shown in Fig.5d, the CO 2 reduction activity of Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN was significantly lower than that of N v -CN, indicating that Al-O bond were not the adsorption and activation sites for CO 2 .In contrast, MgO/N v -CN showed a high photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity, demonstrating that MgO was the active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and activation.Meanwhile, the activity of MgO-Al 2 O 3 / N v -CN was slightly lower than that of MgO/N v -CN, further demonstrating that Al-O bond was unfavorable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The activity of MgAl LDO/N v -CN was much higher than that of MgO/N v -CN, which may be related to the synergistic effect of MgO and Al 2 O 3 in MgAl LDO.In particular, the low-coordinated O 2-in Mg-O can promote the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , and the coordinated unsaturated AI 3 can promote the adsorption and dissociation of H 2 O, while this effect is only present in MgAl LDO and not in the mixed oxides of MgO and Al 2 O 3 .To understand the relationship between MgAl LDO and N v -CN, the CO 2 reduction activities of 10 MgAl LDH/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and physically mixed MgAl LDO and N v -CN (M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN) were compared under the same conditions.The MgAl LDH/N v -CN exhibited a higher activity than N v -CN, which may be due to the formation of a heterojunction structure between MgAl LDH and N v -CN.The M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN was much less active than N v -CN, suggesting that a tight contact between MgAl LDO and N v -CN must exist to achieve efficient CO 2 reduction.Compared with CN, the CO 2 reduction activity of 10 MgAl LDO/CN was increased, which was caused by the enhanced CO 2 adsorption from the surface Lewis base of MgAl LDO.However, the CO 2 reduction activity of 10 MgAl LDO/CN was much lower than that of 10 MgAl LDO/N v -CN, probably because MgAl LDO is an adsorption site rather than a catalytic site for the CO 2 reduction reaction.Therefore, it is hypothesized that the enhanced MgAl LDO/N v -CN activity should result from the multiple synergistic effects of the nitrogen defect and MgAl LDO.Furthermore, C-N v -CN was obtained without the addition of MgAl LDH during the synthesis of MgAl LDO/N v -CN, and the activity of C-N v -CN for the reduction of CO 2 did not change significantly compared to that of N v -CN, indicating that the synergistic effect of MgAl LDO and nitrogen defects in MgAl LDO/N v -CN is the main factor causing the increased activity of N v -CN.

LDH/N v -CN, M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and C-N v -CN for CO 2 reduction was investigated under the same conditions (Fig.5d).The morphologies of MgO/N v -CN, Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN, MgO-Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDH/N v -CN, M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and C-N v -CN were shown in FigureS2, similar to N v -CN nanosheets, which may be attributed to the low oxide loading.As shown in Fig.5d, the CO 2 reduction activity of Al 2 O 3 /N v -CN was significantly lower than that of N v -CN, indicating that Al-O bond were not the adsorption and activation sites for CO 2 .In contrast, MgO/N v -CN showed a high photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity, demonstrating that MgO was the active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and activation.Meanwhile, the activity of MgO-Al 2 O 3 / N v -CN was slightly lower than that of MgO/N v -CN, further demonstrating that Al-O bond was unfavorable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The activity of MgAl LDO/N v -CN was much higher than that of MgO/N v -CN, which may be related to the synergistic effect of MgO and Al 2 O 3 in MgAl LDO.In particular, the low-coordinated O 2-in Mg-O can promote the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , and the coordinated unsaturated AI 3 can promote the adsorption and dissociation of H 2 O, while this effect is only present in MgAl LDO and not in the mixed oxides of MgO and Al 2 O 3 .To understand the relationship between MgAl LDO and N v -CN, the CO 2 reduction activities of 10 MgAl LDH/N v -CN, 10 MgAl LDO/CN and physically mixed MgAl LDO and N v -CN (M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN) were compared under the same conditions.The MgAl LDH/N v -CN exhibited a higher activity than N v -CN, which may be due to the formation of a heterojunction structure between MgAl LDH and N v -CN.The M-MgAl LDO/N v -CN was much less active than N v -CN, suggesting that a tight contact between MgAl LDO and N v -CN must exist to achieve efficient CO 2 reduction.Compared with CN, the CO 2 reduction activity of 10 MgAl LDO/CN was increased, which was caused by the enhanced CO 2 adsorption from the surface Lewis base of MgAl LDO.However, the CO 2 reduction activity of 10 MgAl LDO/CN was much lower than that of 10 MgAl LDO/N v -CN, probably because MgAl LDO is an adsorption site rather than a catalytic site for the CO 2 reduction reaction.Therefore, it is hypothesized that the enhanced MgAl LDO/N v -CN activity should result from the multiple synergistic effects of the nitrogen defect and MgAl LDO.Furthermore, C-N v -CN was obtained without the addition of MgAl LDH during the synthesis of MgAl LDO/N v -CN, and the activity of C-N v -CN for the reduction of CO 2 did not change significantly compared to that of N v -CN, indicating that the synergistic effect of MgAl LDO and nitrogen defects in MgAl LDO/N v -CN is the main factor causing the increased activity of N v -CN.
