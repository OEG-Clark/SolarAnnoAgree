Such design provides five advantages.First, because the catalysts are immobilized on the carbon paper, complicated catalyst separation process encountered in slurry reactors is eliminated.Second, because the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane separates the gas phase from the liquid phase and CO 2 can directly transport to the photocatalysts, the CO 2 mass transport issue can be efficiently overcome.Third, oxygen is a well-known product of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which can promote the product re-oxidation 24.The developed membrane structure cannot only benefit for the CO 2 transport but also favor the O 2 removal directly from the membrane to the gas chamber, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic reaction rate.Forth, the incorporation of optofluidics into the membrane reactor design can greatly increase the surface-area-to-volume ratio, enhancing the mass transport.Fifth, the microreactor design not only greatly reduces the light transport length but also makes the light distribution more uniform, which can enhance the light utilization.As a result, the proposed microreactor can improve the performance of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The preparation procedure of this composite membrane is presented as follows, which included three steps: the preparation of the TiO 2 colloid, spraying TiO 2 onto the carbon paper and hydrophobic treatment of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper.In the first step, commercial TiO 2 powders with the mean particle size of 25 nm (Degussa P25) were used as the photocatalyst due to its high stability and durability.The TiO 2 colloid was prepared by solegel method 25.To do this, 12 g TiO 2 powders were added into the mixture of 120 mL DI water and 0.4 mL of acetylacetone (SigmaeAldrich) with magnetic stirring.0.2 mL Triton X-100 was then added to facilitate the spreading of the colloid.After that, 2.4 g polyethylene glycol (Chengdu Kelong, China) was added into the solution, which was then continuously stirred for 12 h to form the TiO 2 colloid.In the second step, the as-received carbon paper (Shanghai Hesen, China) with the thickness of 280 mm and the dimension of 2.0 cm A 4.0 cm was firstly covered by a paper mask with a 1.0 cm A 1.0 cm hole.Then, the prepared colloid was sprayed onto the carbon paper.After removing the paper mask, the TiO 2 coated carbon paper was dried at room temperature and then calcined in air at 550 C for 2 h.With the assistance of the paper mask, a TiO 2 film with the active surface area of 1 cm 2 was formed on the carbon paper.Due to the surface of the carbon paper is exceedingly rough, TiO 2 powders could be immobilized firmly on the carbon paper.Because the developed composite membrane needs to prevent the water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber, the hydrophobic treatment of the TiO 2 coated carbon paper has to be done at the final step.To do this, PTFE solution was sprayed onto the other side of carbon paper without the TiO 2 film to increase its hydrophobicity and then heated in air at 360 C for 1 h.The PTFE loading was about 1 mg/cm 2 . The microstructures of the prepared photocatalytic membrane and its cross-section were observed using focused ion beam (FIB) (Zeiss AURIGA) and scanning electron microscopy (TESCAN VEGA3 SBH), respectively.The results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that a uniform porous TiO 2 film was formed on the carbon paper.The pore size ranged from a few hundred of nanometers to one micrometer.Such microstructure could not only benefit for providing the photon pathway to enhance the light utilization but also enhance the transport of water and CO 2 .Fig. 2b shows the cross-section of the composite membrane.It can be seen that a porous TiO 2 film was successfully coated onto the carbon paper with the thickness of about 40 mm for the catalyst loading of 4.5 mg/ cm 2 .The observed cracks along the thickness direction may be due to the cutting process after liquid nitrogen cooling.In addition, the wettability of the carbon paper is also critically important in the phase separation because the i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 4 1 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 2 4 5 7 e2 4 6 5 hydrophobicity can provide large capillary force to resist the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.Hence, the wettability of the side of the carbon paper hydrophobically treated by PTFE was characterized by dipping a water droplet on it.The contact angle was then measured by the image technique.As seen in Fig. 3, before the PTFE treatment, the as-received carbon paper showed slightly hydrophobic nature with the contact angle of about 105 .Although it was hydrophobic, the water leakage was still observed in our testing, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the as-received carbon paper is insufficient to avoid the liquid water leakage.It was also found that after high temperature calcination of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper at 550 C, a liquid water droplet could not be formed on the side of the carbon paper without the TiO 2 coating.Because of this, the image result is not shown in this text.This fact indicates that the asreceived carbon paper became hydrophilic after high temperature calcination and the hydrophobic treatment is necessary to successfully operate the microreactor.As shown in Fig. 3b, after the PTFE treatment of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper, the contact angle could reach about 138 , meaning that the carbon paper has become rather hydrophobic.Our testing also showed that the liquid water leakage was not observed after the PTFE treatment.Hence, the developed the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane can realize the role of the separation between the liquid phase and gas phase.In this work, the absorption spectra of the prepared TiO 2 film was also measured by the UVevis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the result is displayed in Fig. 4. It was shown that the overwhelming majority of absorbed light was below the wavelength of 400 nm in the UVeVis spectra.According to the UVeVis spectrum, the band gap, E g , could also be calculated to be 3.1 eV by the following equation 26, where m 14 A0.017 and b 14 6.79 stands for the slope and intercept that were achieved by fitting the data in the linear region of the UVeVis spectrum. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the prepared composite membrane was sandwiched between two plates made by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) because PMMA is a good transparent material and sealed by two PTFE gaskets.These two plates were fabricated by laser ablation.On both the plates, a rectangular chamber with 4.5 cm A 3.0 cm A 1.0 mm was firstly fabricated for positioning the PTFE gaskets.In the center of this chamber, a reaction microchamber with the dimensions of 1.0 cm A 1.0 cm in length and width and 80 mm in height was further fabricated, which resulted in a reaction volume of 8 mL.At both the ends of the microchamber, a triangular shape inlet and outlet were designed, respectively.Such design is to avoid the bubbles trapped in the microchamber during the liquid water filling process at the beginning.Two 3-mm holes were drilled at both the PMMA plates. For the liquid water side, two syringe needles were connected to the inlet and outlet for the liquid water supply and product collection.For the gas CO 2 side, since the flow rate of CO 2 was relatively high in our experiment, two pneumatic connectors were used to connect the inlet and outlet of the PMMA plate.The connections of both the pneumatic connectors and syringe needles to the PMMA plates were enhanced by using UV light adhesive curing under 365 nm UV irradiation to avoid the leakage.During the assembly process, two gaskets were firstly put onto the PMMA plates and then the prepared TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane was sandwiched between them.Finally, eight screws were used for tightening the optofluidic membrane microreactor.The image of the fabricated optofluidic membrane microreactor is given in Fig. 5b. The experimental system is schematically shown in Fig. 6.The OMMR was operated with the continuous mode and irradiated by a 100 W LED with the wavelength of 365 nm (Lightwells, Shenzhen, China).Fig. 7 shows the spectrum of the UV LED lamp, which was measured by spectrograph (Ocean Optics, QE65000).It can be seen that the major light concentrated on 365 nm, which was consistent with the parameter provided by the manufacturer.The UV light intensity was controlled by adjusting the distance between the microreactor and LED, and measured by a UV radiometer (UV-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, China).Liquid water was pumped into the liquid microchamber by a syringe pump (Pump 33, Harvard).99.5 CO 2 gas was supplied to the gas microchamber with the flow rate controlled by a gas volumetric flowmeter (LZB-3, Nanjing, China).In all experiments, the flow rate of CO 2 was maintained at 25 mL/min.In addition, blank tests were also carried out to ensure that methanol was solely from photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which was performed by supplying nitrogen into the gas microchamber.No methanol was detected so that methanol solely originated from CO 2 could be confirmed.In this work, the methanol concentration was analyzed by a GC (GC-2010 plus, Shimazu) equipped with the FID detector with the lowest detectability of 1.5 pgC/s using a 30-m Wax capillary column.The chromatographic grade methanol (Aladdin) was used to prepare the CH 3 OH calibration liquid solutions with different concentration for obtaining the calibration curve.All experiments were repeated at least three times under room temperature of about 25 C.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "The TiO 2 -coated carbon paper with the PTFE treatment was designed and fabricated as the composite membrane for separating the gas phase from liquid phase and providing the reaction layer for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with liquid water.", "context": "In this study, we combined the advantages of both optofluidics and membrane reactors to develop a novel optofluidic membrane microreactor for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to increase the specific surface area and to enhance the mass and photon transport and to enable uniform light distribution.The TiO 2 -coated carbon paper with the PTFE treatment was designed and fabricated as the composite membrane for separating the gas phase from liquid phase and providing the reaction layer for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with liquid water.The methanol yield was measured to evaluate the performance of the microreactor.Experimental results showed that after the PTFE treatment, the developed photocatalytic membrane was rather hydrophobic, which was sufficient to prevent the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.More importantly, it is delightful to see that the developed microreactor can exhibit appreciable performance.Parametric studies showed that the methanol concentration at the outlet decreased with increasing the liquid water flow rate.Combining the effect of the liquid water flow rate on the methanol yield, it was found that the methanol yield firstly increased and then decreased with increasing the liquid water flow rate.Upgrading the light intensity led to an increase in both the methanol concentration and yield.There existed an optimal catalyst loading to maximize the methanol yield for given conditions.A maximum methanol yield of 111.0 mmole/g-cat h was achieved at a flow rate of 25 mL/min and under the light intensity of 8 mW/cm 2 and the catalyst loading of 4.5 mg/cm 2 .Compared with the reported data, the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor developed in this work is among the top.Results obtained fully demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of this new type of photoreactor for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .

It can be seen from Fig. 2a that a uniform porous TiO 2 film was formed on the carbon paper.The pore size ranged from a few hundred of nanometers to one micrometer.Such microstructure could not only benefit for providing the photon pathway to enhance the light utilization but also enhance the transport of water and CO 2 .Fig. 2b shows the cross-section of the composite membrane.It can be seen that a porous TiO 2 film was successfully coated onto the carbon paper with the thickness of about 40 mm for the catalyst loading of 4.5 mg/ cm 2 .The observed cracks along the thickness direction may be due to the cutting process after liquid nitrogen cooling.In addition, the wettability of the carbon paper is also critically important in the phase separation because the i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 4 1 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 2 4 5 7 e2 4 6 5 hydrophobicity can provide large capillary force to resist the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.Hence, the wettability of the side of the carbon paper hydrophobically treated by PTFE was characterized by dipping a water droplet on it.The contact angle was then measured by the image technique.As seen in Fig. 3, before the PTFE treatment, the as-received carbon paper showed slightly hydrophobic nature with the contact angle of about 105 .Although it was hydrophobic, the water leakage was still observed in our testing, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the as-received carbon paper is insufficient to avoid the liquid water leakage.It was also found that after high temperature calcination of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper at 550 C, a liquid water droplet could not be formed on the side of the carbon paper without the TiO 2 coating.Because of this, the image result is not shown in this text.This fact indicates that the asreceived carbon paper became hydrophilic after high temperature calcination and the hydrophobic treatment is necessary to successfully operate the microreactor.As shown in Fig. 3b, after the PTFE treatment of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper, the contact angle could reach about 138 , meaning that the carbon paper has become rather hydrophobic.Our testing also showed that the liquid water leakage was not observed after the PTFE treatment.Hence, the developed the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane can realize the role of the separation between the liquid phase and gas phase.In this work, the absorption spectra of the prepared TiO 2 film was also measured by the UVevis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the result is displayed in Fig. 4. It was shown that the overwhelming majority of absorbed light was below the wavelength of 400 nm in the UVeVis spectra.According to the UVeVis spectrum, the band gap, E g , could also be calculated to be 3.1 eV by the following equation 26, where m 14 A0.017 and b 14 6.79 stands for the slope and intercept that were achieved by fitting the data in the linear region of the UVeVis spectrum. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the prepared composite membrane was sandwiched between two plates made by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) because PMMA is a good transparent material and sealed by two PTFE gaskets.These two plates were fabricated by laser ablation.On both the plates, a rectangular chamber with 4.5 cm A 3.0 cm A 1.0 mm was firstly fabricated for positioning the PTFE gaskets.In the center of this chamber, a reaction microchamber with the dimensions of 1.0 cm A 1.0 cm in length and width and 80 mm in height was further fabricated, which resulted in a reaction volume of 8 mL.At both the ends of the microchamber, a triangular shape inlet and outlet were designed, respectively.Such design is to avoid the bubbles trapped in the microchamber during the liquid water filling process at the beginning.Two 3-mm holes were drilled at both the PMMA plates. For the liquid water side, two syringe needles were connected to the inlet and outlet for the liquid water supply and product collection.For the gas CO 2 side, since the flow rate of CO 2 was relatively high in our experiment, two pneumatic connectors were used to connect the inlet and outlet of the PMMA plate.The connections of both the pneumatic connectors and syringe needles to the PMMA plates were enhanced by using UV light adhesive curing under 365 nm UV irradiation to avoid the leakage.During the assembly process, two gaskets were firstly put onto the PMMA plates and then the prepared TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane was sandwiched between them.Finally, eight screws were used for tightening the optofluidic membrane microreactor.The image of the fabricated optofluidic membrane microreactor is given in Fig. 5b. The experimental system is schematically shown in Fig. 6.The OMMR was operated with the continuous mode and irradiated by a 100 W LED with the wavelength of 365 nm (Lightwells, Shenzhen, China).Fig. 7 shows the spectrum of the UV LED lamp, which was measured by spectrograph (Ocean Optics, QE65000).It can be seen that the major light concentrated on 365 nm, which was consistent with the parameter provided by the manufacturer.The UV light intensity was controlled by adjusting the distance between the microreactor and LED, and measured by a UV radiometer (UV-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, China).Liquid water was pumped into the liquid microchamber by a syringe pump (Pump 33, Harvard).99.5 CO 2 gas was supplied to the gas microchamber with the flow rate controlled by a gas volumetric flowmeter (LZB-3, Nanjing, China).In all experiments, the flow rate of CO 2 was maintained at 25 mL/min.In addition, blank tests were also carried out to ensure that methanol was solely from photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which was performed by supplying nitrogen into the gas microchamber.No methanol was detected so that methanol solely originated from CO 2 could be confirmed.In this work, the methanol concentration was analyzed by a GC (GC-2010 plus, Shimazu) equipped with the FID detector with the lowest detectability of 1.5 pgC/s using a 30-m Wax capillary column.The chromatographic grade methanol (Aladdin) was used to prepare the CH 3 OH calibration liquid solutions with different concentration for obtaining the calibration curve.All experiments were repeated at least three times under room temperature of about 25 C.", "vote": "1"}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "LED", "source": "The OMMR was operated with the continuous mode and irradiated by a 100 W LED with the wavelength of 365 nm (Lightwells, Shenzhen, China).", "context": "Unlike conventional designs where the photocatalysts were coated onto the inner surface of photoreactors or suspended in solutions and CO 2 is dissolved in liquid water or fed into the reactors in the bubble form, in the OMMR, the liquid water and CO 2 gas are separated by a membrane.As sketched in Fig. 1, in this design, two reaction microchambers are separated by a photocatalytic membrane.One is functioned as the liquid microchamber and the other is functioned as the gas microchamber.During the working process, liquid distilled water is pumped into the liquid microchamber and gaseous CO 2 is supplied into the gas microchamber, respectively.UV light is illuminated from the top through the liquid microchamber to excite the electronehole pairs in TiO 2 .CO 2 is transported through the membrane to TiO 2 film.With the help of the photo-excited electronehole pairs, the transported CO 2 is then reduced on the surface of TiO 2 and reacts with water to generate hydrocarbon fuels.It is clear that the key to the successful OMMR is the development of the catalytic membrane.In this work, we developed a TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane.As known, carbon paper has been widely used in conventional proton exchange membrane fuel cells 23, because it is chemically stable and highly porous, which can provide sufficient pathways for mass transport.For this reason, we also used the carbon paper as the supporting layer in this composite membrane and then coated TiO 2 powders on the carbon paper.Another important issue is the hydrophobic treatment of the carbon paper to prevent the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.Hence, the PTFE was employed in this work to treat the other side of the carbon paper without the TiO 2 film, which finally increased the hydrophobocity of the carbon paper to prevent the water leakage. Such design provides five advantages.First, because the catalysts are immobilized on the carbon paper, complicated catalyst separation process encountered in slurry reactors is eliminated.Second, because the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane separates the gas phase from the liquid phase and CO 2 can directly transport to the photocatalysts, the CO 2 mass transport issue can be efficiently overcome.Third, oxygen is a well-known product of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which can promote the product re-oxidation 24.The developed membrane structure cannot only benefit for the CO 2 transport but also favor the O 2 removal directly from the membrane to the gas chamber, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic reaction rate.Forth, the incorporation of optofluidics into the membrane reactor design can greatly increase the surface-area-to-volume ratio, enhancing the mass transport.Fifth, the microreactor design not only greatly reduces the light transport length but also makes the light distribution more uniform, which can enhance the light utilization.As a result, the proposed microreactor can improve the performance of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .

Such design provides five advantages.First, because the catalysts are immobilized on the carbon paper, complicated catalyst separation process encountered in slurry reactors is eliminated.Second, because the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane separates the gas phase from the liquid phase and CO 2 can directly transport to the photocatalysts, the CO 2 mass transport issue can be efficiently overcome.Third, oxygen is a well-known product of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which can promote the product re-oxidation 24.The developed membrane structure cannot only benefit for the CO 2 transport but also favor the O 2 removal directly from the membrane to the gas chamber, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic reaction rate.Forth, the incorporation of optofluidics into the membrane reactor design can greatly increase the surface-area-to-volume ratio, enhancing the mass transport.Fifth, the microreactor design not only greatly reduces the light transport length but also makes the light distribution more uniform, which can enhance the light utilization.As a result, the proposed microreactor can improve the performance of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The preparation procedure of this composite membrane is presented as follows, which included three steps: the preparation of the TiO 2 colloid, spraying TiO 2 onto the carbon paper and hydrophobic treatment of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper.In the first step, commercial TiO 2 powders with the mean particle size of 25 nm (Degussa P25) were used as the photocatalyst due to its high stability and durability.The TiO 2 colloid was prepared by solegel method 25.To do this, 12 g TiO 2 powders were added into the mixture of 120 mL DI water and 0.4 mL of acetylacetone (SigmaeAldrich) with magnetic stirring.0.2 mL Triton X-100 was then added to facilitate the spreading of the colloid.After that, 2.4 g polyethylene glycol (Chengdu Kelong, China) was added into the solution, which was then continuously stirred for 12 h to form the TiO 2 colloid.In the second step, the as-received carbon paper (Shanghai Hesen, China) with the thickness of 280 mm and the dimension of 2.0 cm A 4.0 cm was firstly covered by a paper mask with a 1.0 cm A 1.0 cm hole.Then, the prepared colloid was sprayed onto the carbon paper.After removing the paper mask, the TiO 2 coated carbon paper was dried at room temperature and then calcined in air at 550 C for 2 h.With the assistance of the paper mask, a TiO 2 film with the active surface area of 1 cm 2 was formed on the carbon paper.Due to the surface of the carbon paper is exceedingly rough, TiO 2 powders could be immobilized firmly on the carbon paper.Because the developed composite membrane needs to prevent the water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber, the hydrophobic treatment of the TiO 2 coated carbon paper has to be done at the final step.To do this, PTFE solution was sprayed onto the other side of carbon paper without the TiO 2 film to increase its hydrophobicity and then heated in air at 360 C for 1 h.The PTFE loading was about 1 mg/cm 2 . The microstructures of the prepared photocatalytic membrane and its cross-section were observed using focused ion beam (FIB) (Zeiss AURIGA) and scanning electron microscopy (TESCAN VEGA3 SBH), respectively.The results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that a uniform porous TiO 2 film was formed on the carbon paper.The pore size ranged from a few hundred of nanometers to one micrometer.Such microstructure could not only benefit for providing the photon pathway to enhance the light utilization but also enhance the transport of water and CO 2 .Fig. 2b shows the cross-section of the composite membrane.It can be seen that a porous TiO 2 film was successfully coated onto the carbon paper with the thickness of about 40 mm for the catalyst loading of 4.5 mg/ cm 2 .The observed cracks along the thickness direction may be due to the cutting process after liquid nitrogen cooling.In addition, the wettability of the carbon paper is also critically important in the phase separation because the i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 4 1 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 2 4 5 7 e2 4 6 5 hydrophobicity can provide large capillary force to resist the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.Hence, the wettability of the side of the carbon paper hydrophobically treated by PTFE was characterized by dipping a water droplet on it.The contact angle was then measured by the image technique.As seen in Fig. 3, before the PTFE treatment, the as-received carbon paper showed slightly hydrophobic nature with the contact angle of about 105 .Although it was hydrophobic, the water leakage was still observed in our testing, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the as-received carbon paper is insufficient to avoid the liquid water leakage.It was also found that after high temperature calcination of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper at 550 C, a liquid water droplet could not be formed on the side of the carbon paper without the TiO 2 coating.Because of this, the image result is not shown in this text.This fact indicates that the asreceived carbon paper became hydrophilic after high temperature calcination and the hydrophobic treatment is necessary to successfully operate the microreactor.As shown in Fig. 3b, after the PTFE treatment of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper, the contact angle could reach about 138 , meaning that the carbon paper has become rather hydrophobic.Our testing also showed that the liquid water leakage was not observed after the PTFE treatment.Hence, the developed the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane can realize the role of the separation between the liquid phase and gas phase.In this work, the absorption spectra of the prepared TiO 2 film was also measured by the UVevis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the result is displayed in Fig. 4. It was shown that the overwhelming majority of absorbed light was below the wavelength of 400 nm in the UVeVis spectra.According to the UVeVis spectrum, the band gap, E g , could also be calculated to be 3.1 eV by the following equation 26, where m 14 A0.017 and b 14 6.79 stands for the slope and intercept that were achieved by fitting the data in the linear region of the UVeVis spectrum. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the prepared composite membrane was sandwiched between two plates made by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) because PMMA is a good transparent material and sealed by two PTFE gaskets.These two plates were fabricated by laser ablation.On both the plates, a rectangular chamber with 4.5 cm A 3.0 cm A 1.0 mm was firstly fabricated for positioning the PTFE gaskets.In the center of this chamber, a reaction microchamber with the dimensions of 1.0 cm A 1.0 cm in length and width and 80 mm in height was further fabricated, which resulted in a reaction volume of 8 mL.At both the ends of the microchamber, a triangular shape inlet and outlet were designed, respectively.Such design is to avoid the bubbles trapped in the microchamber during the liquid water filling process at the beginning.Two 3-mm holes were drilled at both the PMMA plates. For the liquid water side, two syringe needles were connected to the inlet and outlet for the liquid water supply and product collection.For the gas CO 2 side, since the flow rate of CO 2 was relatively high in our experiment, two pneumatic connectors were used to connect the inlet and outlet of the PMMA plate.The connections of both the pneumatic connectors and syringe needles to the PMMA plates were enhanced by using UV light adhesive curing under 365 nm UV irradiation to avoid the leakage.During the assembly process, two gaskets were firstly put onto the PMMA plates and then the prepared TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane was sandwiched between them.Finally, eight screws were used for tightening the optofluidic membrane microreactor.The image of the fabricated optofluidic membrane microreactor is given in Fig. 5b. The experimental system is schematically shown in Fig. 6.The OMMR was operated with the continuous mode and irradiated by a 100 W LED with the wavelength of 365 nm (Lightwells, Shenzhen, China).Fig. 7 shows the spectrum of the UV LED lamp, which was measured by spectrograph (Ocean Optics, QE65000).It can be seen that the major light concentrated on 365 nm, which was consistent with the parameter provided by the manufacturer.The UV light intensity was controlled by adjusting the distance between the microreactor and LED, and measured by a UV radiometer (UV-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, China).Liquid water was pumped into the liquid microchamber by a syringe pump (Pump 33, Harvard).99.5 CO 2 gas was supplied to the gas microchamber with the flow rate controlled by a gas volumetric flowmeter (LZB-3, Nanjing, China).In all experiments, the flow rate of CO 2 was maintained at 25 mL/min.In addition, blank tests were also carried out to ensure that methanol was solely from photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which was performed by supplying nitrogen into the gas microchamber.No methanol was detected so that methanol solely originated from CO 2 could be confirmed.In this work, the methanol concentration was analyzed by a GC (GC-2010 plus, Shimazu) equipped with the FID detector with the lowest detectability of 1.5 pgC/s using a 30-m Wax capillary column.The chromatographic grade methanol (Aladdin) was used to prepare the CH 3 OH calibration liquid solutions with different concentration for obtaining the calibration curve.All experiments were repeated at least three times under room temperature of about 25 C.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "Membrane", "source": "As sketched in Fig. 1, in this design, two reaction microchambers are separated by a photocatalytic membrane.", "context": "Unlike conventional designs where the photocatalysts were coated onto the inner surface of photoreactors or suspended in solutions and CO 2 is dissolved in liquid water or fed into the reactors in the bubble form, in the OMMR, the liquid water and CO 2 gas are separated by a membrane.As sketched in Fig. 1, in this design, two reaction microchambers are separated by a photocatalytic membrane.One is functioned as the liquid microchamber and the other is functioned as the gas microchamber.During the working process, liquid distilled water is pumped into the liquid microchamber and gaseous CO 2 is supplied into the gas microchamber, respectively.UV light is illuminated from the top through the liquid microchamber to excite the electronehole pairs in TiO 2 .CO 2 is transported through the membrane to TiO 2 film.With the help of the photo-excited electronehole pairs, the transported CO 2 is then reduced on the surface of TiO 2 and reacts with water to generate hydrocarbon fuels.It is clear that the key to the successful OMMR is the development of the catalytic membrane.In this work, we developed a TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane.As known, carbon paper has been widely used in conventional proton exchange membrane fuel cells 23, because it is chemically stable and highly porous, which can provide sufficient pathways for mass transport.For this reason, we also used the carbon paper as the supporting layer in this composite membrane and then coated TiO 2 powders on the carbon paper.Another important issue is the hydrophobic treatment of the carbon paper to prevent the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.Hence, the PTFE was employed in this work to treat the other side of the carbon paper without the TiO 2 film, which finally increased the hydrophobocity of the carbon paper to prevent the water leakage.

Such design provides five advantages.First, because the catalysts are immobilized on the carbon paper, complicated catalyst separation process encountered in slurry reactors is eliminated.Second, because the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane separates the gas phase from the liquid phase and CO 2 can directly transport to the photocatalysts, the CO 2 mass transport issue can be efficiently overcome.Third, oxygen is a well-known product of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which can promote the product re-oxidation 24.The developed membrane structure cannot only benefit for the CO 2 transport but also favor the O 2 removal directly from the membrane to the gas chamber, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic reaction rate.Forth, the incorporation of optofluidics into the membrane reactor design can greatly increase the surface-area-to-volume ratio, enhancing the mass transport.Fifth, the microreactor design not only greatly reduces the light transport length but also makes the light distribution more uniform, which can enhance the light utilization.As a result, the proposed microreactor can improve the performance of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The preparation procedure of this composite membrane is presented as follows, which included three steps: the preparation of the TiO 2 colloid, spraying TiO 2 onto the carbon paper and hydrophobic treatment of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper.In the first step, commercial TiO 2 powders with the mean particle size of 25 nm (Degussa P25) were used as the photocatalyst due to its high stability and durability.The TiO 2 colloid was prepared by solegel method 25.To do this, 12 g TiO 2 powders were added into the mixture of 120 mL DI water and 0.4 mL of acetylacetone (SigmaeAldrich) with magnetic stirring.0.2 mL Triton X-100 was then added to facilitate the spreading of the colloid.After that, 2.4 g polyethylene glycol (Chengdu Kelong, China) was added into the solution, which was then continuously stirred for 12 h to form the TiO 2 colloid.In the second step, the as-received carbon paper (Shanghai Hesen, China) with the thickness of 280 mm and the dimension of 2.0 cm A 4.0 cm was firstly covered by a paper mask with a 1.0 cm A 1.0 cm hole.Then, the prepared colloid was sprayed onto the carbon paper.After removing the paper mask, the TiO 2 coated carbon paper was dried at room temperature and then calcined in air at 550 C for 2 h.With the assistance of the paper mask, a TiO 2 film with the active surface area of 1 cm 2 was formed on the carbon paper.Due to the surface of the carbon paper is exceedingly rough, TiO 2 powders could be immobilized firmly on the carbon paper.Because the developed composite membrane needs to prevent the water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber, the hydrophobic treatment of the TiO 2 coated carbon paper has to be done at the final step.To do this, PTFE solution was sprayed onto the other side of carbon paper without the TiO 2 film to increase its hydrophobicity and then heated in air at 360 C for 1 h.The PTFE loading was about 1 mg/cm 2 . The microstructures of the prepared photocatalytic membrane and its cross-section were observed using focused ion beam (FIB) (Zeiss AURIGA) and scanning electron microscopy (TESCAN VEGA3 SBH), respectively.The results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that a uniform porous TiO 2 film was formed on the carbon paper.The pore size ranged from a few hundred of nanometers to one micrometer.Such microstructure could not only benefit for providing the photon pathway to enhance the light utilization but also enhance the transport of water and CO 2 .Fig. 2b shows the cross-section of the composite membrane.It can be seen that a porous TiO 2 film was successfully coated onto the carbon paper with the thickness of about 40 mm for the catalyst loading of 4.5 mg/ cm 2 .The observed cracks along the thickness direction may be due to the cutting process after liquid nitrogen cooling.In addition, the wettability of the carbon paper is also critically important in the phase separation because the i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 4 1 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 2 4 5 7 e2 4 6 5 hydrophobicity can provide large capillary force to resist the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.Hence, the wettability of the side of the carbon paper hydrophobically treated by PTFE was characterized by dipping a water droplet on it.The contact angle was then measured by the image technique.As seen in Fig. 3, before the PTFE treatment, the as-received carbon paper showed slightly hydrophobic nature with the contact angle of about 105 .Although it was hydrophobic, the water leakage was still observed in our testing, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the as-received carbon paper is insufficient to avoid the liquid water leakage.It was also found that after high temperature calcination of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper at 550 C, a liquid water droplet could not be formed on the side of the carbon paper without the TiO 2 coating.Because of this, the image result is not shown in this text.This fact indicates that the asreceived carbon paper became hydrophilic after high temperature calcination and the hydrophobic treatment is necessary to successfully operate the microreactor.As shown in Fig. 3b, after the PTFE treatment of the TiO 2 -coated carbon paper, the contact angle could reach about 138 , meaning that the carbon paper has become rather hydrophobic.Our testing also showed that the liquid water leakage was not observed after the PTFE treatment.Hence, the developed the TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane can realize the role of the separation between the liquid phase and gas phase.In this work, the absorption spectra of the prepared TiO 2 film was also measured by the UVevis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the result is displayed in Fig. 4. It was shown that the overwhelming majority of absorbed light was below the wavelength of 400 nm in the UVeVis spectra.According to the UVeVis spectrum, the band gap, E g , could also be calculated to be 3.1 eV by the following equation 26, where m 14 A0.017 and b 14 6.79 stands for the slope and intercept that were achieved by fitting the data in the linear region of the UVeVis spectrum. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the prepared composite membrane was sandwiched between two plates made by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) because PMMA is a good transparent material and sealed by two PTFE gaskets.These two plates were fabricated by laser ablation.On both the plates, a rectangular chamber with 4.5 cm A 3.0 cm A 1.0 mm was firstly fabricated for positioning the PTFE gaskets.In the center of this chamber, a reaction microchamber with the dimensions of 1.0 cm A 1.0 cm in length and width and 80 mm in height was further fabricated, which resulted in a reaction volume of 8 mL.At both the ends of the microchamber, a triangular shape inlet and outlet were designed, respectively.Such design is to avoid the bubbles trapped in the microchamber during the liquid water filling process at the beginning.Two 3-mm holes were drilled at both the PMMA plates. For the liquid water side, two syringe needles were connected to the inlet and outlet for the liquid water supply and product collection.For the gas CO 2 side, since the flow rate of CO 2 was relatively high in our experiment, two pneumatic connectors were used to connect the inlet and outlet of the PMMA plate.The connections of both the pneumatic connectors and syringe needles to the PMMA plates were enhanced by using UV light adhesive curing under 365 nm UV irradiation to avoid the leakage.During the assembly process, two gaskets were firstly put onto the PMMA plates and then the prepared TiO 2 /carbon paper composite membrane was sandwiched between them.Finally, eight screws were used for tightening the optofluidic membrane microreactor.The image of the fabricated optofluidic membrane microreactor is given in Fig. 5b. The experimental system is schematically shown in Fig. 6.The OMMR was operated with the continuous mode and irradiated by a 100 W LED with the wavelength of 365 nm (Lightwells, Shenzhen, China).Fig. 7 shows the spectrum of the UV LED lamp, which was measured by spectrograph (Ocean Optics, QE65000).It can be seen that the major light concentrated on 365 nm, which was consistent with the parameter provided by the manufacturer.The UV light intensity was controlled by adjusting the distance between the microreactor and LED, and measured by a UV radiometer (UV-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, China).Liquid water was pumped into the liquid microchamber by a syringe pump (Pump 33, Harvard).99.5 CO 2 gas was supplied to the gas microchamber with the flow rate controlled by a gas volumetric flowmeter (LZB-3, Nanjing, China).In all experiments, the flow rate of CO 2 was maintained at 25 mL/min.In addition, blank tests were also carried out to ensure that methanol was solely from photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which was performed by supplying nitrogen into the gas microchamber.No methanol was detected so that methanol solely originated from CO 2 could be confirmed.In this work, the methanol concentration was analyzed by a GC (GC-2010 plus, Shimazu) equipped with the FID detector with the lowest detectability of 1.5 pgC/s using a 30-m Wax capillary column.The chromatographic grade methanol (Aladdin) was used to prepare the CH 3 OH calibration liquid solutions with different concentration for obtaining the calibration curve.All experiments were repeated at least three times under room temperature of about 25 C.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "A maximum methanol yield of 111.0 mmole/g-cat h was achieved at a flow rate of 25 mL/min and under the light intensity of 8 mW/cm 2 and the catalyst loading of 4.5 mg/cm 2 .", "context": "In this study, we combined the advantages of both optofluidics and membrane reactors to develop a novel optofluidic membrane microreactor for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to increase the specific surface area and to enhance the mass and photon transport and to enable uniform light distribution.The TiO 2 -coated carbon paper with the PTFE treatment was designed and fabricated as the composite membrane for separating the gas phase from liquid phase and providing the reaction layer for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with liquid water.The methanol yield was measured to evaluate the performance of the microreactor.Experimental results showed that after the PTFE treatment, the developed photocatalytic membrane was rather hydrophobic, which was sufficient to prevent the liquid water leakage from the liquid microchamber to the gas microchamber.More importantly, it is delightful to see that the developed microreactor can exhibit appreciable performance.Parametric studies showed that the methanol concentration at the outlet decreased with increasing the liquid water flow rate.Combining the effect of the liquid water flow rate on the methanol yield, it was found that the methanol yield firstly increased and then decreased with increasing the liquid water flow rate.Upgrading the light intensity led to an increase in both the methanol concentration and yield.There existed an optimal catalyst loading to maximize the methanol yield for given conditions.A maximum methanol yield of 111.0 mmole/g-cat h was achieved at a flow rate of 25 mL/min and under the light intensity of 8 mW/cm 2 and the catalyst loading of 4.5 mg/cm 2 .Compared with the reported data, the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor developed in this work is among the top.Results obtained fully demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of this new type of photoreactor for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .
