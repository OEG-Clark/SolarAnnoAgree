The anatase phase of TiO 2 increased in volume fraction with increased calcination temperature and iodine levels.The photocatalytic activities of the I-TiO 2 powders were investigated by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible light ( 400 nm) and also under UV-vis illumination.CO was found to be the major photoreduction product using both undoped and doped TiO 2 .A high CO 2 reduction activity was observed for I-TiO 2 catalysts (highest CO yield equivalent to 2.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) under visible light, and they also had much higher CO 2 photoreduction efficiency than undoped TiO 2 under UV-vis irradiation.I-TiO 2 calcined at 375 C has superior activity to those calcined at higher temperatures.Optimal doping levels of iodine were identified under visible and UV-vis irradiations, respectively.This is the first study that investigates nonmetal doped TiO 2 without other co-catalysts for CO 2 photoreduction to fuels under visible light.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "The crystal structures of the prepared catalysts were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Scintag XDS 2000) using Cu K irradiation at 45 kV and a diffracted beam monochromator operated at 40 mA in the 2A range from 20 to 70 at a scan rate of 1 /min.", "context": "The method for synthesis of I-doped TiO 2 was modified from that reported by Tojo et al. 33.The preparation started by dissolv-ing 3 ml of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) (Acros Organic, 98) in 3 ml of anhydrous isopropanol (Acros Organic, 99.5).The mixture was then added dropwise into a solution of iodic acid (HIO 3 ) (Alfa Aesar, 99.5) with continuous stirring for 2 h.After the reaction, the resultant white mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined vessel for hydrothermal treatment at 100 C for 12 h.The resultant yellow particles were filtrated and washed with copious amount of de-ionized water until pH 7 followed by drying in an oven at 80 C for 1 h.The samples were finally calcined in air for 2 h at different temperatures (375, 450, or 550 C).Different iodine doping levels were prepared by varying the quantity of HIO 3 added (0.06-0.18 g).The samples are denoted in the way of \"x I-TiO 2 -yC\", where x is the nominal weight percentage of iodine in the sample (calculated from the bulk solution) and y is the calcination temperature.For example, 5 I-TiO 2 -375C represents 5 wt. (nominal) I-doped TiO 2 calcined at 375 C. For comparison, undoped TiO 2 was prepared following the same procedure without adding HIO 3 .All samples were grinded and sieved by a 45 m stainless steel sieve before characterization and photoreduction experiments. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis by N 2 adsorption was performed using a Quantachrome NOVA 1200 gas sorption analyzer (Boynton Beach, FL).The crystal structures of the prepared catalysts were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Scintag XDS 2000) using Cu K irradiation at 45 kV and a diffracted beam monochromator operated at 40 mA in the 2A range from 20 to 70 at a scan rate of 1 /min.The crystal size of different crystal phases was calculated by the Scherrer equation.The fractional phase content, W A , W B , and W R , for anatase, brookite, and rutile, respectively, are mathematically defined in Eqs. ( 1)-(3) 34: where A A , A B and A R represent the integrated intensity of the anatase (1 0 1) peak (2A 25.28 ), the brookite (1 2 1) peak (2A 30.81 ), and the rutile (1 1 0) peak (2A 27.45 ), respectively.Because the brookite (1 2 0) (2A 25.34 ) and brookite (1 1 1) (2A 25.69 ) peaks overlap with the anatase (1 0 1) peak, A A and A B were calculated by the following method.Using the single isolated brookite (1 2 1) peak as a reference, the anatase (1 0 1), brookite (1 2 0) and brookite (1 1 1) overlapped peaks were deconvoluted by 0.9 and 0.8 intensity ratio for I (1 2 1) (brookite) /I (1 2 0) (brookite) and I (1 1 1) (brookite) /I (1 2 0) (brookite) respectively, with the same FWHM of brookite (1 2 1) 35. The lattice structure of individual nanocrystals was visualized by phase-contrast high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) carried out with 300 keV electrons in a Hitachi H9000NAR instrument with 0.18 nm point and 0.11 nm lattice resolution.Two-dimensional Fourier transforms were calculated and used to measure lattice spacing and interplanar angles.Amplitude contrast TEM images were used to obtain direct information about the nanocrystal sizes.Selected area electron diffraction (SAD) provided information that is analogous to XRD, but from nanocrystals supported on an electron-transparent amorphous carbon film and selected within a 450 nm diameter aperture. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained by a UV-vis spectrometer (Ocean Optics) using BaSO 4 as the back- ground.The reflectance was converted to F(R) values using the Kubelka-Munk function (Eq.( 4)). where R is the absolute reflectance, k is the molar absorption coefficient and s is the scattering coefficient.The band gaps were obtained from the plot of F(R)E ph 1/2 against the photon energy E ph .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a PerkinElmer PHI 5100 ESCA system with an Al K X-ray source (h 1253.6eV) and pass energy of 35.75 eV operating at a pressure of 8 10 -10 Torr.The observed spectra were corrected with the C1s binding energy (BE) value of 284.6 eV. The schematic of the photocatalytic reaction system is illustrated in Fig. 1.Compressed CO 2 (99.99,Praxair) regulated by a mass flow controller was passed through a water bubbler to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapor mixture (H 2 O, v/v 2.3).The gas mixture was then purged through a cylindrical photoreactor (V 58 cm 3 ) with stainless steel walls and a quartz window.A fixed amount of powder catalyst (200 mg) was dispersed on a glass-fiber filter and placed at the bottom of the reactor.After purging for 1.5 h, the gas valves on both sides of the reactor were closed to seal the reactor.A 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel) was used as the light source and a longpass filter was applied to cut off the short wavelengths that are less than 400 nm if only visible light is needed.A spectroradiometer (International Light Technologies ILT950) was used to obtain the spectral intensity of the Xe lamp with and without the filter.During the illumination period, the gaseous samples in the reactor were taken by a gastight syringe (Hamilton, 1750, 500 l) every 30 min and manually injected to a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID). Prior to CO 2 photoreduction experiments, all catalyst powders were pre-treated under UV irradiation (12 W, 365 nm) for 12 h to eliminate organic residues on the catalyst, if any.GC measurements were also performed using a mixture of ultra high purity helium (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor as the purging and reaction gas for the catalyst-loaded reactor; no carbon-containing compounds were produced by the catalyst under UV or visible irradiation.This verifies that the catalyst was clean (i.e.no interference from organic residues).A series of other background tests were also conducted using a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor as the purging and reaction gas for both cases of (1) empty reactor and (2) blank glass-fiber filter in the reactor.Again, for either case no carbon-containing compounds were produced under either UV or visible irradiation.This demonstrates that the reactor and the glass-fiber filter were clean and that the CO 2 conversion cannot proceed without the photocatalyst.All these background tests have proved that any carbon-containing compounds produced must be originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "I-doped TiO2", "source": "I-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts with different iodine doping levels and calcination temperatures were prepared and for the first time were tested for the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O.", "context": "I-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts with different iodine doping levels and calcination temperatures were prepared and for the first time were tested for the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O.The iodine dopant extended the absorption spectra of TiO 2 to the visible light region and facilitated charge separation.XPS analysis revealed that I 5 substitutes Ti 4 in the lattice and as a result, Ti 3 is generated to balance the charge.Significant enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction to CO was observed for I-doped TiO 2 compared with undoped TiO 2 under both visible and UV-vis irradiations.The high activity of CO 2 reduction under visible light compared to the literature data makes I-doped TiO 2 a potentially cost-effective photocatlayst.Lower calcination temperature (375 C) resulted in smaller particle size and higher catalytic activity.10 I-doping level demonstrated the highest CO 2 photoreduction rate under visible light, while 5 I-doping level performed best under UV-vis irradiation.Too high an iodine doping level may result in recombination centers and thus lower the photocatalytic activity.Further work is needed to determine if the nanocrystal morphology changes as a function of doping level and annealing conditions, especially for the preparations that show superior photocatalytic activity.
