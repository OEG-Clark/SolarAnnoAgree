The process of CO 2 photoreduction is as follows: The photocatalyst (20 mg) was dispersed into 15 mL water with stirring in the quartz tube, firstly pumped a vacuum of the reaction tube and then bubbled using high purity CO 2 gas, repeated the process for three times to exhaust the air in the tube and filled with enough CO 2 gas.A 25 W UV LED lamp was applied as the light source.The gas was collected and monitored via GC-7920 gas chromatograph using flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detectors within a given time interval. Transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on a CHI660e electrochemical analyzer (Shanghai Chen Hua Instruments) in a standard three-electrode configuration using Na 2 SO 4 (0.1 mol L -1 ) aqueous solution as the electrolyte.The films of TiO 2 samples deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass were employed as the working electrode.A Pt plate and Ag/ AgCl were acted as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.300 W Xe lamp was supplied as light source.EIS measurements were observed using a 10 mV alternating current amplitude in a range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz frequency.Mott-Schottky tests were measured under 10 mV amplitude at the frequencies of 0.8 kHz and 1 kHz, respectively. Density functional theory as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) was employed to optimize geometry structures for TiO 2 -A and TiO 2-x with FLPs 34.The exchange-correlation interactions were described by the generalised gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (PBE) 35.A cut-off energy of 500 eV for plain-wave basis sets was adopted and the convergence threshold was 10 -5 eV, and 5 10 -3 eV/A for energy and force, respectively.The weak interaction was described by DFT D3 method using empirical correction in Grimme's scheme 36.The vacuum space was set to be more than 20 A, which was enough to avoid the interaction between periodical images.For TiO 2 (1 0 1) structure, a 23 supercell has been used during the calculation, and the GGA U function was performed with the U eff (U eff Coulomb Uexchange J) values of 4.0 eV for Ti atoms.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "No specific reactor type is mentioned in the text, but the experiment is likely conducted in a slurry reactor.", "context": "In summary, we demonstrate that anatase TiO 2-x hierarchical hollow boxes with FLPs could be obtained by in situ topological transformation of perovskite for efficient photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The O Vs acted as Lewis acid sites and its proximal surface hydroxyls acted as Lewis base sites, together construct the surface FLPs of TiO 2-x , and the sample exhibited the outstanding abilities for the adsorption and activation of CO 2 .TiO 2-x hollow hierarchical boxes with FLPs show highly enhanced activity for the reduction of CO 2 to CO without employing any sacrificial agents or cocatalysts.Our finding opens a new route to construct FLPs on the single-component solid photocatalyst surface through in situ topological transformation, and also provides a novel way to create high efficient photocatalysts for the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy.
