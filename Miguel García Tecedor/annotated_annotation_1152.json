Preparation of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was fabricated through in-situ polymerization of BMIm C(CN) 3 on BiVO 4 (Fig. 1(a)).Typically, 0.05 g BMIm C(CN) 3 ionic liquid was firstly dissolved in 10 mL ethyl acetate.Then, 1 g BiVO 4 was dispersed in the above mixture and ultrasonicated for 30 min.After that, ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation.The mixture was heated to 400 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min and kept for an hour.The collected sample was alternately washed using ethyl acetate and deionized water.In this way, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different ratios of hm-C 4 N 3 (0.1, 0.067, 0.05 and 0.04 g) were gained and expressed as BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (10:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (15:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 (20:1) and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 (25:1).

For investigation of the CO 2 photoconversion, the reaction area is 4.2 cm 2 with 100 mg of photocatalyst evenly decentralized on the quartz paper while the total volume of reactor was approximately 420 mL.The air of reactor was extracted three times before irradiation to reach vacuum state, then the high purity CO 2 and 0.4 mL of deionized water were introduced for reaching ambient pressure.The system was kept for several hours to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium at dark condition.The light source was supported by a 300 W Xenon lamp for photocatalytic reaction.1 mL of gas was continuously brought out from the container every 1 h interval using a gas chromatography with FID and TCD detectors (GC-2014C, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) for subsequent analysis.The process lasted for 6 h with irradiation.The isotope-labelled analyses were measured applying 13 CO 2 and H 2 18 O to replace the original CO 2 and H 2 O.The gas mixtures were analyzed on a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (QP2010SE, Shimadzu Corp., Japan).Three cycling experiments were measured to estimate the stability of the photocatalyst. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was determined under the same photoconversion condition while the light source was LED with the wavelength of 385 nm, 420 nm and 520 nm (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co.

For photodegradation experiment towards methylene blue, the reaction was irradiated with Xenon lamp.50 mg catalyst was dispersed into 25 mg/L MB solution (100 mL).Then, the system was dark-stirred to achieve an adsorption-desorption equilibrium for 30 min.During the process of irradiation, 5 mL of the solution was drawn out and the photocatalyst was filtered out before testing every 20 min.The concentration of MB was measured by monitoring the Ultraviolet-visible absorption ability using a UV-5100B spectrometer and detected at wavelength of 665 nm. The test of scavengers was carried out to investigate the prominent reactive species generated by the photocatalysts upon irradiation.During the photodegradation of MB, the radicals of O 2 -was scavenged by isopropanol (IPA) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), respectively.In addition, these radicals were trapped by DMPO agent while the signals were detected by the ESR technique.Before determination, 10 mg sample was added to 0.5 mL deionized water for detection of OH radical and using 0.5 mL methanol as the solvent for investigation of O 2 radical, respectively.Subsequently, accompanied by ultrasonic dispersion, 50 L of DMPO was added to the above solutions, respectively.The results were collected after 5 min of illumination.

Preparation of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was fabricated through in-situ polymerization of BMIm C(CN) 3 on BiVO 4 (Fig. 1(a)).Typically, 0.05 g BMIm C(CN) 3 ionic liquid was firstly dissolved in 10 mL ethyl acetate.Then, 1 g BiVO 4 was dispersed in the above mixture and ultrasonicated for 30 min.After that, ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation.The mixture was heated to 400 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min and kept for an hour.The collected sample was alternately washed using ethyl acetate and deionized water.In this way, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different ratios of hm-C 4 N 3 (0.1, 0.067, 0.05 and 0.04 g) were gained and expressed as BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (10:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (15:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 (20:1) and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 (25:1).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with CASTEP package based on the plane-wave-pseudo-potential algorithm 31.The correlation and exchange interactions were simulated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 32.The Tkatchenko -Scheffler method was used to correct the Van der Waals interactions DFT-D 33.While the ultrasoft pseudopotential was used to describe the interactions between the atomic core and the valence electrons with a cutoff energy of 450 eV 34.After the geometry optimization, all atoms were permitted to relax without any restrict until the convergence thresholds of maximum displacement, maximum force and energy were smaller than 0.001 A, 0.03 eV/A and 1.0 10 -5 eV/atom, respectively.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "Fig. 6.(a) Degradation curves of methylene blue for different catalysts under visible light", "context": "In summary, a direct Z-Scheme photocatalyst with erythroid-like hierarchical architecture composed by organic half-metal hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 was prepared and used for overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion.The uniform wrappage of hm-C 4 N 3 on BiVO 4 endow the photocatalyst with much abundant heterojunction interfaces and exposed reactive sites.The superior CO 2 capture, activation and charge deliver features of hm-C 4 N 3 are all integrated in photoreduction reactive site of the Z-Scheme heterojunction.The overall photocatalytic CO 2 and H 2 O conversion to CO and O 2 are realized.In particular, the optimized BiVO 4 / hm-C 4 N 3 composite presented a prominent photocatalytic activity, its CO generation rate reaches 40.8 mol g -1 h -1 with excellent selectivity beyond 97 , exceeding most of the reported Z-Scheme system used for photoreduction of CO 2 .On the one hand, this well-defined Z-Scheme heterojunction can promote the separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs, on the other hand, it enhances the oxidation and reduction capabilities of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .DFT calculation and in-situ DRIFTS spectra indicate that the process of COOH dehydration is the ratedetermining step.The supplement of proton by H 2 O oxidation from BiVO 4 and the prolonged lifetime of electrons on hm-C 4 N 3 contribute to the remarkable decreased reaction barrier simultaneously.This work proposes a fantastic approach to develop organic half-metal based photocatalyst, and shed new light on the way to the target of artificial photosynthesis. Preparation of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was fabricated through in-situ polymerization of BMIm C(CN) 3 on BiVO 4 (Fig. 1(a)).Typically, 0.05 g BMIm C(CN) 3 ionic liquid was firstly dissolved in 10 mL ethyl acetate.Then, 1 g BiVO 4 was dispersed in the above mixture and ultrasonicated for 30 min.After that, ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation.The mixture was heated to 400 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min and kept for an hour.The collected sample was alternately washed using ethyl acetate and deionized water.In this way, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different ratios of hm-C 4 N 3 (0.1, 0.067, 0.05 and 0.04 g) were gained and expressed as BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (10:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (15:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 (20:1) and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 (25:1).

Preparation of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was fabricated through in-situ polymerization of BMIm C(CN) 3 on BiVO 4 (Fig. 1(a)).Typically, 0.05 g BMIm C(CN) 3 ionic liquid was firstly dissolved in 10 mL ethyl acetate.Then, 1 g BiVO 4 was dispersed in the above mixture and ultrasonicated for 30 min.After that, ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation.The mixture was heated to 400 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min and kept for an hour.The collected sample was alternately washed using ethyl acetate and deionized water.In this way, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different ratios of hm-C 4 N 3 (0.1, 0.067, 0.05 and 0.04 g) were gained and expressed as BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (10:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (15:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 (20:1) and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 (25:1).
