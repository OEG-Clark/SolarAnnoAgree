Various samples of TiO 2 powders were synthesized by thermal hydrolysis using TTIP as precursor and ethanol as hydrolysis agent.In addition, some samples were doped with Cu(II) using Cu(acac) 2 as precursor.These samples were supported on carbon nanotubes.In all the procedures, supercritical CO 2 was used as reaction medium. The synthesis of photocatalysts was performed in an ad hoc designed experimental set-up (Fig. 1).The heart of the installation is a stainless-steel high-pressure reactor (DEMEDE Engineering Research, 100 ml) preceded by a high-pressure pump (Thar SFC, Pseries) for the compression of CO 2 and a thermostatic bath (Selecta, Frigiterm-30).After reactor there is a filter. In this work, two types of synthesis (one-step and two-step syntheses) have been compared in order to study the influence of procedure on catalysts properties. The synthesis is relatively simple.First, titanium precursor, alcohol, carbon nanotubes, and copper precursor (if necessary) are added to the reactor.The masses of TTIP and CNT change depending on CNT/TiO 2 proportion.The molar ratio of ethanol was always 28 mmol/mmol titanium precursor, equivalent to 8 mol ethanol in CO 2 22.Then, the installation was sealed, and CO 2 introduced into the reactor after being cooled in the thermostatic bath.Afterwards, the magnetic stirring was turned on, the reactor warmed up with an electric resistance, and pressure increased until values required for the synthesis (300 C and 200 bar) 9,22.After 2 h, the electric resistance was turned off.When the temperature of reactor was appropriate the system was depressurized.After the synthesis process, solids obtained were removed from the reactor and dried at 105 C for 24 h.Then, they were calcined at 400 C for 3 h to remove the remaining structural solvent 9 and to transform most TiO 2 into anatase 23.The limit in the calcination temperature was given by the transition from anatase to rutile phases, together with the combustion of CNTs, both phenomena taking place at about 550 C 4,15,24.Thus, several references report that materials calcined with air at 400 C for 2 h do not exhibit appreciable degradation of CNT 15,25. The first step is the hydrothermal synthesis of TiO 2 and TiO 2 /Cu nanoparticles.It is carried out under the same conditions that onestep synthesis but in the absence of CNT 22. In the second step, the previously synthesized nanoparticles were supported onto CNT.For this, the TiO 2 and TiO 2 /Cu nanoparticles were introduced into the reactor together with CNT, being the total mass of mixture 200 mg for all CNT/TiO 2 weight ratios tested (0.25, 1 and 4).In this case, operating conditions were 60 C and 100 bar for 2 h, with magnetic stirring 26.The solid product was dried at 105 C for 24 h and calcined at 400 C for 3 h.CNT 50 /P25 50 also was synthesized in these conditions.In this case scCO 2 is used as a replacement of a flammable and toxic liquid solvent in wet stirring process for nanopowder mixing, helping to deagglomerate TiO 2 particles and CNT and distributing nanoparticles more evenly on the nanotubes 26. Table 1 lists all synthesized catalysts with the corresponding codes used to identify them from now on. All the synthesized photocatalysts and commercial catalyst were characterized with different analytical techniques.An Xray powder diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'Pert MPD) was used to determine crystallinity and crystalline phase of the catalysts.Crystallite size was calculated from the Scherrer equation using the X-ray diffraction peak at 2A 25.4 .A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol 6490LV) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Jeol 2100) were used to obtain information about the morphology of the catalysts.A diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectrophotometer (Jasco, V650) was employed to obtain absorbance thresholds and band gap energies.The specific surface area of the powders was measured using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area analyser (Quantachrome Nova Touch LX2).The percentage of Cu was measured with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spec- troscopy (ICP-AES) using an ICP-AES (Varian, Liberty Sequential). The detection limit of ICP spectrometer is 20 ppb Cu.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement (XPS) was made in an ultrahigh vacuum Specs Phoibos-150 electron spectrometer.The spectra were obtained with a photon energy of 1486.6 eV (Al anode).All the binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.5 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. The catalyst activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is evaluated with an ad hoc designed experimental set-up (Fig. 2).It consists of a stainless-steel reactor (50 ml) with an O-ring sealed quartz window for admitting radiation from a Xe arc lamp (Oriel, 450 W) with an Air Mass 1.5 Global filter to simulate the solar irradiation.Before the reaction chamber there is a valve for gas introduction and a bubbler with deionized H 2 O to provide the necessary relative humidity.Pressure, temperature and humidity measurements are carried out with appropriate instruments connected to the reactor.After it there is a valve for evacuation and other valve connected to a gas chromatography system (Agilent 490 Micro GC, with micro thermal conductivity detector, TCD).This equipment supplies qualitative and quantitative data of the reduction products obtained. The photocatalytic experiment consists of two stages 9: (a) Preparation of the filter: 50 mg of catalyst are dispersed in 1 l of deionized water, next the solution is passed through a filter (diameter 0.47 mm, pore size 0.45 m) and dried at 180 C for 30 min.(b) Photocatalysis: The filter is placed on a stainless-steel grid into the reactor.Then, the reactor chamber is filled with a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide (H 2 O/CO 2 wt. ratio of 2/7).When the operating conditions are reached (1.12 bar, 32 C, and a relative humidity of 73 ), the lamp is turned on.After 3 h reaction the products are determined with the gas chromatograph.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 nanoparticles, CNT/TiO2 composites, metal-doped TiO2 catalysts, CNT/TiO2/Cu ternary composites, P25", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized with supercritical fluids is increased when they are supported on carbon nanotubes at appropriate synthesis conditions.

For CNT/TiO 2 /Cu ternary composites, the effect of copper doping is overshadowed by the effect of CNT support (in the 0.5-5 weight percentage range investigated).This fact was observed when analyzing both physicochemical properties of the composites and their photocatalytic activities. For CNT/TiO 2 binary and CNT/TiO 2 /Cu ternary composites, the synthesis in one step is better than the two-step method because the former is not only faster and more efficient, but it also yields more active catalysts for CO 2 photoreduction.Additionally, the one-stage method is more environmentally friendly since it implies a reduction in energy consumption and reagents, as well as in the production of wastes. In order to further increase the kinetics of the CO 2 photoreduction and the variety of products resulting from the reaction, novel advanced TiO 2 based catalyst should be developed considering the use both new dopants (such as metals, non-metals or MOFs) and new carbon supports (such as graphene).

For CNT/TiO 2 binary and CNT/TiO 2 /Cu ternary composites, the synthesis in one step is better than the two-step method because the former is not only faster and more efficient, but it also yields more active catalysts for CO 2 photoreduction.Additionally, the one-stage method is more environmentally friendly since it implies a reduction in energy consumption and reagents, as well as in the production of wastes. In order to further increase the kinetics of the CO 2 photoreduction and the variety of products resulting from the reaction, novel advanced TiO 2 based catalyst should be developed considering the use both new dopants (such as metals, non-metals or MOFs) and new carbon supports (such as graphene).

Various samples of TiO 2 powders were synthesized by thermal hydrolysis using TTIP as precursor and ethanol as hydrolysis agent.In addition, some samples were doped with Cu(II) using Cu(acac) 2 as precursor.These samples were supported on carbon nanotubes.In all the procedures, supercritical CO 2 was used as reaction medium. The synthesis of photocatalysts was performed in an ad hoc designed experimental set-up (Fig. 1).The heart of the installation is a stainless-steel high-pressure reactor (DEMEDE Engineering Research, 100 ml) preceded by a high-pressure pump (Thar SFC, Pseries) for the compression of CO 2 and a thermostatic bath (Selecta, Frigiterm-30).After reactor there is a filter. In this work, two types of synthesis (one-step and two-step syntheses) have been compared in order to study the influence of procedure on catalysts properties. The synthesis is relatively simple.First, titanium precursor, alcohol, carbon nanotubes, and copper precursor (if necessary) are added to the reactor.The masses of TTIP and CNT change depending on CNT/TiO 2 proportion.The molar ratio of ethanol was always 28 mmol/mmol titanium precursor, equivalent to 8 mol ethanol in CO 2 22.Then, the installation was sealed, and CO 2 introduced into the reactor after being cooled in the thermostatic bath.Afterwards, the magnetic stirring was turned on, the reactor warmed up with an electric resistance, and pressure increased until values required for the synthesis (300 C and 200 bar) 9,22.After 2 h, the electric resistance was turned off.When the temperature of reactor was appropriate the system was depressurized.After the synthesis process, solids obtained were removed from the reactor and dried at 105 C for 24 h.Then, they were calcined at 400 C for 3 h to remove the remaining structural solvent 9 and to transform most TiO 2 into anatase 23.The limit in the calcination temperature was given by the transition from anatase to rutile phases, together with the combustion of CNTs, both phenomena taking place at about 550 C 4,15,24.Thus, several references report that materials calcined with air at 400 C for 2 h do not exhibit appreciable degradation of CNT 15,25. The first step is the hydrothermal synthesis of TiO 2 and TiO 2 /Cu nanoparticles.It is carried out under the same conditions that onestep synthesis but in the absence of CNT 22. In the second step, the previously synthesized nanoparticles were supported onto CNT.For this, the TiO 2 and TiO 2 /Cu nanoparticles were introduced into the reactor together with CNT, being the total mass of mixture 200 mg for all CNT/TiO 2 weight ratios tested (0.25, 1 and 4).In this case, operating conditions were 60 C and 100 bar for 2 h, with magnetic stirring 26.The solid product was dried at 105 C for 24 h and calcined at 400 C for 3 h.CNT 50 /P25 50 also was synthesized in these conditions.In this case scCO 2 is used as a replacement of a flammable and toxic liquid solvent in wet stirring process for nanopowder mixing, helping to deagglomerate TiO 2 particles and CNT and distributing nanoparticles more evenly on the nanotubes 26. Table 1 lists all synthesized catalysts with the corresponding codes used to identify them from now on. All the synthesized photocatalysts and commercial catalyst were characterized with different analytical techniques.An Xray powder diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'Pert MPD) was used to determine crystallinity and crystalline phase of the catalysts.Crystallite size was calculated from the Scherrer equation using the X-ray diffraction peak at 2A 25.4 .A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol 6490LV) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Jeol 2100) were used to obtain information about the morphology of the catalysts.A diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectrophotometer (Jasco, V650) was employed to obtain absorbance thresholds and band gap energies.The specific surface area of the powders was measured using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area analyser (Quantachrome Nova Touch LX2).The percentage of Cu was measured with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spec- troscopy (ICP-AES) using an ICP-AES (Varian, Liberty Sequential). The detection limit of ICP spectrometer is 20 ppb Cu.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement (XPS) was made in an ultrahigh vacuum Specs Phoibos-150 electron spectrometer.The spectra were obtained with a photon energy of 1486.6 eV (Al anode).All the binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.5 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. The catalyst activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is evaluated with an ad hoc designed experimental set-up (Fig. 2).It consists of a stainless-steel reactor (50 ml) with an O-ring sealed quartz window for admitting radiation from a Xe arc lamp (Oriel, 450 W) with an Air Mass 1.5 Global filter to simulate the solar irradiation.Before the reaction chamber there is a valve for gas introduction and a bubbler with deionized H 2 O to provide the necessary relative humidity.Pressure, temperature and humidity measurements are carried out with appropriate instruments connected to the reactor.After it there is a valve for evacuation and other valve connected to a gas chromatography system (Agilent 490 Micro GC, with micro thermal conductivity detector, TCD).This equipment supplies qualitative and quantitative data of the reduction products obtained. The photocatalytic experiment consists of two stages 9: (a) Preparation of the filter: 50 mg of catalyst are dispersed in 1 l of deionized water, next the solution is passed through a filter (diameter 0.47 mm, pore size 0.45 m) and dried at 180 C for 30 min.(b) Photocatalysis: The filter is placed on a stainless-steel grid into the reactor.Then, the reactor chamber is filled with a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide (H 2 O/CO 2 wt. ratio of 2/7).When the operating conditions are reached (1.12 bar, 32 C, and a relative humidity of 73 ), the lamp is turned on.After 3 h reaction the products are determined with the gas chromatograph.", "vote": "0"}]}}
