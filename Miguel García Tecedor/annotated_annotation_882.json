Cu 2 O octahedrons were prepared according to the literature 33 with a little modification.Typically, 3.33 g of PVP was dissolved in 100 mL aqueous CuCl 2 2H 2 O (0.01 M) solution under magnetic stirring.Then, 10 mL of NaOH solution (2 M) was dropped onto the above solution with stirring for 30 mins.Color of the solution turned rapidly from pale blue to turbid blue and finally to dark brown.Afterwards, 6 mmol of aqueous ascorbic acid was added dropwise to the above suspension with aging for another 3 h.All the above procedures were conducted under continuous stirring at a fixed temperature of 60 C.The resultant brick-red precipitates were separated by repeating centrifugation-washing cycles with H 2 O and ethanol and dried under vacuum at 60 C overnight.The as-obtained powders were further annealed at 400 C under N 2 environment during different periods.Before the calcination, N 2 gas was flowed for 30 mins to purge air away from the oven.The prepared photocatalysts were denoted as Cu 2 O, Cu 2 O-1, Cu 2 O-2 and Cu 2 O-3 for samples calcined for 0, 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively.During the CO 2 PR test, the Cu 2 O-1 sample showed the best activity.Therefore, most characterizations were devoted to this sample and pristine Cu 2 O unless otherwise stated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained using D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with CuK radiation ( 1.5406 A) at a scan rate of 0.05(2) S -1 .Raman spectroscopy was performed on Micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw InVia) with back-scattering geometry and 630 nm Ar laser as an excitation source.Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (JSM-7500F, JEOL, Japan) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) (Oxford Instruments, UK), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM (Titan G2 60-300 operated at 300 kV) were used to investigate the morphologies, microstructure and elemental distributions of the prepared samples.The surface composition and chemical states of Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O-3 samples were tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo ESCALAB 250).Diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to investigate the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) light absorption of the studied samples.BaSO 4 was used as the reflectance standard.To determine the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (S BET ) and porosity of the prepared samples, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption and CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus (USA).The pore size, average pore size and pore volume of the samples were calculated through the Barret-Joyner-Halender (BJH) method.Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-7000 (Japan) Scheme 1.

The electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode configuration analyzer (CHI660C instruments, CHI, China) system where Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were utilized as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The working electrode was prepared from the synthesized materials as follows: 15 mg of the fine catalysts and 10 L of Nafion solution were thoroughly dispersed in 3 mL of absolute ethanol to form a homogeneous paste.This paste was then spread on a pre-treated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (1.0 1.0 cm -2 ) glass and air-dried at room temperature to obtain the working electrodes.The three-electrode system was then immersed in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte.
