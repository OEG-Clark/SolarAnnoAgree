The crystal phases of samples were analyzed on a Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) operating at 40 kV and 15 mA with Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm).The morphology and microstructures were observed with a Verios field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and a JEOL LaB 6 JEM-2100(HR) high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM).Specific surface area (S BET ) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions were measured via liquid N 2 adsorption/desorption experiment at -196 C using a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 system after the sample was degassed at 120 C for 3 h.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were determined on an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO 4 as the reference.Element valence states and valence band spectra were detected on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (AlK, 1486.6 eV).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4600 fluorimeter.A Bruker S4 Pioneer X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer was used to determine the elemental compositions of various samples with Rh target and without standard sample. CHI Model 618C electrochemical analyzer was used to obtain the transient photocurrent curves in a three-electrode system with Pt wire, Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as work, counter and reference electrode, respectively.Work electrode was fabricated by depositing Nafion suspension (0.20 mL) containing sample (10 mg) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1.0 1.0 cm 2 ), and drying at 70 C for 1 h to volatilize the solvent and steady the film.During the photoelectrochemical measurement, the three electrodes were immersed into an electrolyte containing Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.5 M) and methyl viologen (3.0 mg) as electron media, which was continuously purged by N 2 flow for 30 min before illumination. Temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II-Cirrus 2 Chemisorption Analyzer.The sample was heated to 200 C with a heating rate of 10 C min -1 in Ar atmosphere and maintained at this temperature for 2 h to remove the adsorbate.After cooling to 80 C, a wet 10 CO 2 /Ar mixed gas replaced the Ar flow for the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption for 90 min, and the excessive CO 2 /H 2 O molecules were purged with Ar flow for 1 h (All flow rates are set at 30 mL min -1 ).After that, TCD detector started to record the signals until the temperature raised to 900 C, and the desorbed gas during the H 2 O/CO 2 -TPD process was installed to a quadruple mass spectrometer (MKS Instrument) operating in multiple-ion-monitoring (MIM) mode to record the mass signals of CO 2 (M/z 44) and H 2 O (M/z 18).In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample under light irradiation were measured on a Thermo Electron Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with liquid N 2 cooled HgCdTe (MCT/A) detector with a resolution of 4 cm -1 by using 64 scans.Typically, sample (0.05 g) was dispersed on the DRIFTS accessory, then vacuum treatment at 200 C for 60 min was conducted for removing the air.After that, humid CO 2 gas (50 mL) was introduced into the reactor until 1 atm.Once the IR spectrum is stabilized, the sample was irradiated with 300 W Xe-lamp through a quartz window, and IR spectrum was collected when it was stabilized again.

TPD-MS spectra of the CO 2 (a) and H 2 O (b) of the single AMS, the 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS as well as 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composites. 138t 1470 cm -1 are enhanced to different degrees after the illumination.Among them, the dramatically increased IR peak of H 2 O (at 1643 cm -1 ) indicates that the AMS surface can adsorb more H 2 O molecules during the illumination.This conjecture can be validated by the newly appeared IR band at 1430 cm -1 and the more obvious ones at 1450, 1415 and 1221 cm -1 during the illumination, which can be due to the adsorbed HCO 3 -, an activation product of H 2 O/CO 28,47.Those increased adsorption of H 2 O and HCO 3-on AMS are conducive to the formation of CH 4 during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process8,46.Whereas the enhanced adsorptions of HCOO -(a possible intermediate for CO 2 RR to CH 4 /CO8,48) with an IR peak at 1610 cm -1 and m-CO 3 2-(which is conducive to the generation of CO13) with a peak at 1470 cm -1 demonstrate that the illumination would cause the CH 4 and CO generation on AMS in the presence of H 2 O/CO 2 .

In a typical step, the above AMS (0.20 g) was dispersed in a H 2 O/ CH 3 OH mixed solvent (60 mL, volume ratio 1:1), then appropriate amount of H 2 PtCl 6 solution (77 mM) was added.After ultrasonic treatment, the suspension was illuminated using 500 W Hg-lamp for 2 h.The precipitate was centrifuged, washed with water and dried at 70 C in vacuum to obtain xPt-AMS composite with x Pt loading.Similarly, 0.20 g of AMS was dispersed in water (60 mL), then appropriate amount of MnSO 4 solution (1.0 M) was added.After ultrasonic treatment, the suspension was illuminated using 500 W Hg-lamp for 2 h.The precipitate was centrifuged, washed with water and dried at 70 C in vacuum to obtain yMn-AMS composite with y MnO x loading. xPt-yMn-AMS was prepared by a two-step method as shown in Scheme 1.Typically, the above AMS (0.20 g) was dispersed in a H 2 O/ CH 3 OH mixed solvent (60 mL, volume ratio 1:1), then appropriate amount of H 2 PtCl 6 solution (77 mM) was added.After ultrasonic treatment, the suspension was illuminated using 500 W Hg-lamp for 2 h.The precipitate was centrifuged and washed with water, and then redispersed in water (60 mL).After adding appropriate amount of MnSO 4 solution (1.0 M) and ultrasonically treatment, the suspension was illuminated using 500 W Hg-lamp for 2 h.The precipitate was centrifuged, washed with water and dried at 70 C in vacuum to obtain xPt-yMn-AMS composite with x Pt and y MnO x co-loadings. The crystal phases of samples were analyzed on a Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) operating at 40 kV and 15 mA with Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm).The morphology and microstructures were observed with a Verios field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and a JEOL LaB 6 JEM-2100(HR) high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM).Specific surface area (S BET ) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions were measured via liquid N 2 adsorption/desorption experiment at -196 C using a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 system after the sample was degassed at 120 C for 3 h.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were determined on an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO 4 as the reference.Element valence states and valence band spectra were detected on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (AlK, 1486.6 eV).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4600 fluorimeter.A Bruker S4 Pioneer X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer was used to determine the elemental compositions of various samples with Rh target and without standard sample. CHI Model 618C electrochemical analyzer was used to obtain the transient photocurrent curves in a three-electrode system with Pt wire, Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as work, counter and reference electrode, respectively.Work electrode was fabricated by depositing Nafion suspension (0.20 mL) containing sample (10 mg) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1.0 1.0 cm 2 ), and drying at 70 C for 1 h to volatilize the solvent and steady the film.During the photoelectrochemical measurement, the three electrodes were immersed into an electrolyte containing Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.5 M) and methyl viologen (3.0 mg) as electron media, which was continuously purged by N 2 flow for 30 min before illumination. Temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II-Cirrus 2 Chemisorption Analyzer.The sample was heated to 200 C with a heating rate of 10 C min -1 in Ar atmosphere and maintained at this temperature for 2 h to remove the adsorbate.After cooling to 80 C, a wet 10 CO 2 /Ar mixed gas replaced the Ar flow for the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption for 90 min, and the excessive CO 2 /H 2 O molecules were purged with Ar flow for 1 h (All flow rates are set at 30 mL min -1 ).After that, TCD detector started to record the signals until the temperature raised to 900 C, and the desorbed gas during the H 2 O/CO 2 -TPD process was installed to a quadruple mass spectrometer (MKS Instrument) operating in multiple-ion-monitoring (MIM) mode to record the mass signals of CO 2 (M/z 44) and H 2 O (M/z 18).In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample under light irradiation were measured on a Thermo Electron Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with liquid N 2 cooled HgCdTe (MCT/A) detector with a resolution of 4 cm -1 by using 64 scans.Typically, sample (0.05 g) was dispersed on the DRIFTS accessory, then vacuum treatment at 200 C for 60 min was conducted for removing the air.After that, humid CO 2 gas (50 mL) was introduced into the reactor until 1 atm.Once the IR spectrum is stabilized, the sample was irradiated with 300 W Xe-lamp through a quartz window, and IR spectrum was collected when it was stabilized again. The photocatalytic CO 2 RR experiment was performed in a gas-closed Pyrex glass reactor (volume of 500 mL) using a 300 W Xe-lamp as light source.Typically, 0.06 g of sample was evenly dispersed on a watch glass (area of 28 cm 2 ) that was placed on a holder in the reactor, then NaHCO 3 (1.60 g) was added into the bottom of reactor.After complete removal of air by vacuum treatment, 5.0 mL of H 2 SO 4 solution (40) was introduced with a syringe to produce CO 2 /H 2 O vapor.During illumination, 2.0 mL of gas was taken out periodically (1.0 h) and detected using a SP-7820 gas chromatograph (TDX-01 column, Rainbow) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanator, product contents are calibrated by an external standardization method using commercial standard gas mixture.In addition, H 2 , O 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 and CH 3 OH were checked using a GC-2010 gas chromatograph (BID detector, Shimadzu), and HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH in the acetic ether extract of the solution in the bottom of reactor after the photoreaction process were detected using an Ascend 400 1 H NMR spectrophotometer (Bruker).It was found that in the present CO 2 RR system, CH 4 and CO are the main reduced products, and occasionally some photocatalysts can produce a small amount of H 2 .No other reduced product such as CH 3 OH, C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 (using GC-FID or GC-BID detector) or HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH (using 1 H NMR spectrum) is detected. Control experiments demonstrated that no reduced product can be produced in the photoreaction system without photocatalyst, light irradiation or CO 2 gas, suggesting that the CH 4 /CO products are generated from the photoreaction of CO 2 /H 2 O over photocatalyst.Because the main reduced products need to consume different numbers of electrons, total consumed electron number (TCEN) of the produced CH 4 /CO is proposed to evaluate the total photoactivity of CO 2 RR using Eq.
