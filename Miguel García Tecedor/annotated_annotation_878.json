The Ag cocatalyst was loaded on the surface of KTO by a photodeposition method (PD) as follows: 1 g of the prepared KTO sample was dispersed in 400 mL of ion-exchanged water containing a required amount of AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd.) as a cocatalyst precursor, and the suspension was irradiated from a 100 W high-pressure Hg lamp with a bubbling flow of argon gas for 2 h, followed by filtration and drying at 353 K in the oven.This sample was referred to as the Ag (PD)/KTO sample.The Ag and MnO x dual cocatalyst was loaded on the KTO surface by four different methods, i.e., a simultaneous PD method, an impregnation (IMP) method, and their combinations.In the simultaneous PD method, both Ag and MnO x species were simultaneously loaded in the PD method by using an aqueous solution containing required amounts of cocatalyst precursors, AgNO 3 and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 (Nacalai tesque co.ltd), according to the same procedure of the PD method as mentioned, which gave the Ag(PD)-MnO x (PD)/KTO sample.In a simultaneous IMP method giving the Ag(IMP)-MnO x (IMP)/KTO sample, 1 g of the prepared KTO sample was suspended in an aqueous solution (150 mL) of desired amounts of AgNO 3 and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 with stirring in a beaker, followed by heating at 358 K to remove water, drying at 373 K for 24 h, and calcination at 723 K for 2 h in the muffle.In a combination of the PD and IMP method, Ag species was first loaded by the PD method, followed by loading MnO x species in the IMP method, providing the MnO x (IMP)/Ag(PD)/KTO sample.Another sample was prepared in the reverse order, i.e., the MnO x species was first loaded on the KTO sample by the IMP method, followed by loading Ag species in the PD method, which was denoted as the Ag(PD)/MnO x (IMP)/KTO sample.Some other samples were also prepared in similar ways, the details will be mentioned later.To show the loaded amount of the components, the samples are referred to as e.g., Ag(PD,x)-MnO x (PD,y)/KTO, where x and y mean the actual loading amount of Ag and Mn (wt ) determined by X-ray florescence analysis (XRF) as mentioned below. The crystal structure of the KTO sample was determined by powder X-ray diffraction with a Lab X XRD-6000 (Shimazu).Morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JSM-890 (JEOL).The amount of cocatalyst deposited on the samples was evaluated by X-ray florescence analysis with an EDX-8000 (Shimadzu) according to each calibration curve that was experimentally obtained from a series of reference samples prepared by the impregnation method.The diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-visible spectrum of the prepared sample was recorded by a V-670 (JASCO).
